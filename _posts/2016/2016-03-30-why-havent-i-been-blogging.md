Ugh.

I haven't written a blog post in two months.

How miserable is that?

I don't really have any real excuse for why. I have an explanation as for why, which I guess could work as an excuse, but that's a pretty lame way out of explaining myself. Which is all I really want to do. Explain why I've been so silent around these parts.

I'm mostly upset at myself to be honest. I've prided myself on updating my blog at least once a month for the past five years. No matter what else was going on in my life I was able to keep that constant going. It was a peculiar source of pride, one I always went to for a quick brag. I'm not sure who I was bragging to where blogging was impressive, but I guess I keep a peculiar set of company.

No, the blame is all on me. I prioritized work way too much over everything else. I felt that I had to finish projects and meet deadlines and keep working without taking any time to do anything else. Even if I had downtime on the weekend, I felt like it wasn't appropriate to blog because I hadn't finished my project.

I was just consumed with getting my work done and didn't think to take time away to do other things. I single-threaded myself (programmer joke). I couldn't multi-task for fear it would cause me to fail elsewhere.

To be clear, all of this was self imposed. I felt I had to commit myself 100% to work and in a large part became a workaholic, not allowing myself any enjoyment beyond the realm of work.

To be fair to myself I have been consumed with two big projects in the past couple of months that I'm not yet ready to talk about, but will be blogging about at length as soon as possible.

It was a stupid move to keep myself myopically bogged down in work for so long.

So this blog post is out with that idea, and in with more blogging.
