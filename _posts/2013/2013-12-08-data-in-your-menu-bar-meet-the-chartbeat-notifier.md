<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://blog.chartbeat.com/tag/hack-week/">Hack Weeks</a> at Chartbeat are always a time of joy. A time of joy for trying and learning new things. It's a great opportunity for everyone at the company to stretch their minds and tackle new challenges they wouldn't otherwise experience. We get to pair up with people we don't usually get a chance to work with, and we get to play around, creating things that sometimes become <a href="https://chartbeat.com/labs/publishing/bigboard/gizmodo.com">indispensable</a>&nbsp;for our clients.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Two Hack Weeks ago I worked on a project called <strong>Chartbeat Notifier</strong>. &nbsp;It was started by our former CTO Allan, and he had already completed a large chunk of it. &nbsp;However it wasn't completely finished, nor was it in a state that we could share. &nbsp;So I finished the Notifier, polishing the parts of the project that needed a little more TLC.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This most recent Hack Week, I pruned off the remaining rough edges and it is with great joy and pride that we are releasing the <a href="https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/ChartbeatNotifier">Chartbeat Notifier project as an open source project</a>!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Chartbeat Notifier is a native Mac application that lives in your menu bar. &nbsp;For your domain it can show one of two metrics in an always visible location:</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;1. the number of concurrent visitors on your domain</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">2. the average engaged time of all the users on the domain</p>

<p dir="ltr">Either number will be always visible in your menu bar, and is continuously updated as the day goes on.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Chartbeat Notifier also serves as a handy way to quickly jump into your dashboard. &nbsp;Simply click on the Chartbeat menu bar icon and the 'Open Dashboard' link and you'll be taken directly to your dashboard. &nbsp;Quick and easy, just the way we like to keep things.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There's only one thing that I love more than Hack Week, and that's when we are able to share our hacks back to the community. &nbsp;Click on over to the <a href="https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/ChartbeatNotifier">Chartbeat Notifier project page</a>&nbsp;and click the download link to get started!</p>
