<p>I'm preparing to move this blog to the new and beautiful blogging software <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>.  I've already been helping out on the GitHub repo, committing code to make sure Ghost is the best it can be.  The fact that it's written in node.js is what truly excites me.  That means I can delve into the codebase with confidence whenever I want to modify the behavior however I'd like.  After all, it's just JavaScript.</p>

<p>WordPress is a mature beast of software.  With that maturity comes a whole heap of features that I've grown incredibly comfortable with.  The entire <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a> suite is truly amazing, adding many features that I rely on daily.  I'm sure in the future Ghost will reach parity with WordPress but at this point WordPress definitely has the edge.</p>

<p>So before I moved my blog to Ghost I wanted to run through and jot down a list of features that that I'll miss.  Thankfully none of these features are deal breakers, and many of them are already <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Roadmap">planned for a future Ghost release</a>.  But I figured I'd run through and make my own list for properties sake.  They're broken up by section in the WordPress admin.
