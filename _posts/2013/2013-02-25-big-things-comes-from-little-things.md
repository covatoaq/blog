<p>One of my fantasies is to start the next Facebook type success story. Make a new website, attract hordes of users, build an influential business, and become wildly successfully.  Many times I've caught myself daydreaming, trying to conjure up that billion dollar idea that will make everything I want come true.</p>

<p>Yet those day dreams never produce anything. It's impossible to dream up a success. It's almost impossible to start with a big idea and work your way backwards from there.</p>

<p>I realized today that you need to start small before anything big can be created. Big things are just collections of small things.  If you start making small things before you know it you'll have that big thing you wanted all along.</p>

<p>Big things come from little things. Start your own little thing today.</p>
