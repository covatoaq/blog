<p>If you look around you can see that I've switched to the new theme that I've been developing over the weekend.  It's made with love and I'm glad I was able to get a working version ready for tonight.</p>

<p>I don't have many details ready to share at the moment as I am a little tired and my brain is slowly grinding to a halt...but rest assured that a thorough run-through on how the new theme was developed will follow.</p>

<p>I think this theme is a nice improvement over the previous theme.  If not in style, then definitely in readability.  That was the focus and I think I achieved my goal.</p>

<p>For now please enjoy the new theme.  If you see any weirdness <a href="/contact">let me know</a>.</p>
