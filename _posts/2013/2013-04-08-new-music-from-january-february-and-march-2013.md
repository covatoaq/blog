<blockquote>
  <p>Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.
  â€• Plato</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love music almost as much as I love sharing music.</p>

<p>If I can share an album that becomes an anthem for you then the amount of joy derived isn't quantifiable.</p>

<p>The following albums weren't necessarily released this year, but it's when I discovered them.</p>

<p>I hope some of them strike your fancy!</p>

<h4>Atoms for Peace - AMOK</h4>

<p>Mostly a side project of Thom Yorke (lead singer of Radiohead), ATP dwells securely in the electronica that made Radiohead's <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em> enjoyable.  If you're a lover of the electronic side of Radiohead then this is an album for you to check out.</p>

<h4>Ducktails - The Flower Lane</h4>

<p>The first couple of listens to this album left me lukewarm: I found the album only mildly appealing.  Somewhere around the fourth listen something clicked and I began to really groove with the record.  If you're looking for a soft and melodic a bum with a band-jam kind of feel then this is the album for you.</p>

<h4>Foals - Holy Fire</h4>

<p>Foals' previous record <em>Total Life Forever</em> is one of my favorite albums, so it's not surprising that I was hotly anticipating their next release.  <em>Holy Fire</em> is a solid album, with the standout single of <em>My Number</em>, however it doesn't flow as smoothly as I had hoped for.  Sometimes more punk or ambience than necessary, my nit-picks aside this is a solid album which stands as a decent follow-up to their previous stellar release.</p>

<h4>Inc. - No World</h4>

<p>Blue eyed soul with splashes of electronica, <em>Inc.</em> whispers into the microphone as they croon over catchy beats and minimalistic riffs.  I've played <em>The Place</em> more times in a row then I'm proud of, half of those plays probably hoping that more tracks on the album were as catchy.  If you like R&amp;B and aren't afraid of alternative influences then I definitely recommend you try out <em>Inc.</em>.</p>

<h4>Josh Ritter - The Beast in Its Tracks</h4>

<p>Singer/songwriter, Josh Ritter is a prolific artist whose soft voice, care-free guitar, and endearing lyrics always leaves me warmed as I let the sun set beyond the horizon.  This album follows that tradition, another thirteen solid tracks, from a songwriter who knows who he is and embodies it fully.</p>

<h4>Justin Timberlake - The 20/20 Experience</h4>

<p>Perhaps deserving of a deeper review due to the cultural relevance of Mr. Timberlake, <em>The 20/20 Experience</em> presents itself as an album not heard on the radio (with the average track length of 7 minutes) when the reality is quite the opposite.  Ever charismatic, each track is full of JT's youthful voice and backed up Timberland's bombastic beats.  This is an album to groove to.</p>

<h4>Lord Huron - Lonesome Dreams</h4>

<p>I don't have any empirical facts about this band, all I know is the sound of this band - and for me that's enough.  At times sounding like Paul Simon (in a very good way), Lord Huron brings a full band-sound to an otherwise solo-singer-songwriter style.  Standout track is easily <em>Time To Run</em>, however each song ably stands on its own.  Fantastic album, already on my best-of list for this year.</p>
