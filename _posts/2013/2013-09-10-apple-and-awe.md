<p>Apple had their iPhone September event today.</p>

<p>I was a little let down by the routine announcements. New <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/" target="_blank">iPhone 5S</a>. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/" target="_blank">iPhone 5C</a> was already widely leaked and not a surprise.</p>

<p>I terribly miss the excitement that Steve Jobs brought to these keynotes. There was a great deal of electricity as he paced the stage.</p>

<p>When he'd perform the 'big reveal' everyone was on the edge of their seats, hanging on his performance.</p>

<p>That is no longer the case.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps it's not a lack of Steve Jobs that has deflated the tone of energy these keynotes previously held.</p>

<p>More likely it's a result of the current technical landscape.  We are now in a  technological lull, where every bit of progress comes in steps as opposed to jumps. Yet that was true when the iPhone was first introduced.  Why is now different?</p>

<p>The excitement of 2007 was one for the record books.  Like a junkie hooked on hype I yearn for its return. I don't care about the technology per se, but the excitement that swirled around its reveal.</p>

<p>When will we have this next big reveal? I hope soon. My heart aches to be awed again.</p>
