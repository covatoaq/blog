<p>Last week I wrote a post for <a href="https://chartbeat.com/" target="_blank">Chartbeat's</a> blog.  It's a nice and fun compilation of frontend development and design links, current as of a month ago.</p>

<p>My favorite of the bunch is definitely the <a href="http://hdragomir.github.io/facetogif/" target="_blank">face to gif</a> tech demo.  I've been having way too much fun with it.</p>
