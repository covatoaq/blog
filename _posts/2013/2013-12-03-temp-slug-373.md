<p>I recently moved my blog to a new sub-domain, blog.harrywolff.com.  I sweated this change for a few weeks, worrying about all the effects it might have.</p>

<p>Would it reduce its visibility?  Would it be possible to do?  Would I regret it in three months time?</p>

<p>I wanted to move my blog because even though it's a big part of my online presence I was growing cramped at the space it took up on my homepage.</p>

<p>Whenever you went to harrywolff.com you'd only see my blog, with a wall of text to follow.  That's a big part of who I am, but it's not the entire story.</p>

<p>I love to tweet, take pictures, and code.  I want my homepage to reflect every aspect of who I am, which my blog did not accomplish.</p>

<p>So it was off with its head!  And delegated to a sub-domain.</p>

<p>I'm digging it so far, and trying to be a little looser with what I post about, with the hope that'll increase the frequency of my posts.</p>

<p>With my recent posts it seems I'm off to a good start.  The real challenge of course being to keep going.</p>
