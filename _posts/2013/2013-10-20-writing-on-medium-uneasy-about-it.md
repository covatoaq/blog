<p>I just finished writing a quick article on <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>.  I've been wanting to try out their writing interface for a while now and I must say it was pretty nice.</p>

<p>It was interesting how it was opinionated.  It forced only one space after a period and any time you would enter two carriage returns it would insert a line break in the article.  Interesting defaults (I suppose not truly default as that there is no alternative option).  Definitely makes for a consistent and pretty look to all the articles on Medium.</p>

<p>You can find my post by <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/796ec6176195">clicking this link here</a>.  It's a little FUD'y but what can you expect for a quick post.</p>

<p>Definitely an interesting experience.  I can't deny that Medium sure is pretty.</p>
