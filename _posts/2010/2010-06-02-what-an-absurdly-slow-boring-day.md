<p style="text-align: justify;">Today was the second day of my summer school.  Last night was my first class, going from 6pm till 9pm in the evening.  I thrive on these night-time classes and activities.  I am most assuredly a night-owl by design and not practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet today was such a bother.  And it was all a bother due to the morning.  Because I had my second class this morning.  My second class begins at 8:30am.  In the morning.  I don’t think I will ever get over this fact.  I haven’t woken up this early for school since High School - and even then, I rarely went to my morning classes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I set my alarm for the lovely time of 7:45am after persuading myself that I would be able to wake up and eat breakfast with enough time left over to be on-time.  This argument held true - I walked into the classroom at the stroke of 8:30am.  However the way in which I woke was anything but delightful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have only the vaguest of memories of how I woke up this morning.  I don’t even know if I woke up due to my alarm clock or because my body wanted to wake up by itself.  How don’t I know?  Because in the middle of eating my morning oatmeal I hear my alarm clock going off.  I think it went off at 8:00am - meaning I hit the snooze button - but I can’t be too sure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the lovely oatmeal I ate (two packets of insta-oatmeal - one isn’t enough) the only other salient memory I have is waking up in a sweat.  I love how the morning sun makes my usually tepid blanket uncomfortably sweltering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a day this one was one that I will remember only due to its non-eventfulness.  So bland was today that this was my only recourse as to content.  If anything this has been one of my most journal and ‘blog-like’ posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a side-note:  I hope my textbook for my on-line course doesn’t take too long to ship.  I love saving money by buying used textbooks but I really hate getting behind on coursework.</p>
