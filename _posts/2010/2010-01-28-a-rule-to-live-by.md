“Nothing good happens after 2 a.m.”

This idea comes from the TV show <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Good_Happens_After_2_A.M.">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, and is an idea which I think is pretty self-explanatory.  Although I found the idea funny when I first heard it, I didn’t really consider it to be ‘true.’

However, as time progresses, and I analyze and evaluate my adventures past 2am, I have come to whole-heartedly agree that nothing good happens after 2am.

This can be true for many reasons.  To name a few:  people are more tired after 2am.

Ok, that wasn’t a few reasons.  It was only one.

I’m sorry, I’m a little tired myself.

It’s after 2am.  I’m up, restless, and hoping this entry serves as proof:

Nothing good happens after 2am.
