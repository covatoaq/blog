<a rel="attachment wp-att-656" href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/08/writing-to-capture-an-emotion/sunset-at-grandpas/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-656 alignright" title="Sunset at Grandpa's" src="/images/posts/2010/08/Sunset-at-Grandpas-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>This morning I woke up with a smile on my face and sunlight sneaking its way past my curtains.  Laying on my back, I watched the curtains twitch and slightly move due to the air conditioner blowing against them.  There was never quite enough pressure to fully move the curtain, but watching it twitch and giggle from the tickling air was fun enough.

Opening the curtains to begin the day is exhilarating: I always seem to forget the brightness mornings bring.  I don’t hold it against myself - the nights are so dark it seems impossible that sunlight would ever return.  Even when I wake up in the middle of the night - at 6am - dawn has only just begun to poke its head around the corner.  It basks everything in an eerie blue-red glow that I can only describe as the nighttime-daytime hand-off.

And then it’s time to revel in my morning ritual of breakfast tea and morning music.  Sipping on the freshly made pot of green tea, while listening to music (that illuminates my surroundings in unnatural sheen of joy), is the moment of the morning that I relish without abandon.  For as I sip my tea, and listen to my tunes, I peer aimlessly out the window and rest while awake.  I enjoy life as I have been taught: loving and dwelling in all that makes me happy.

For it is these simple pleasures that make the days past while keeping a smile on my face.  The time I take to sit and sip my tea is one that nobody can give me.  It’s a pleasure that I must take for myself, one that I must protect and appreciate while occurring.

Of course it would be far too easy to gulp down my tea and run out the door, never giving my mind a second to wake-up to the day and its new intricacies.  This seems to be the modus operandi that society at large seeks to impress on its members.  The get-up, get-going attitude that wears you out before you’ve even begun lunch.

Life isn’t a marathon, we’re all gonna cross the finish line the same way.  It seems pointless to rush to the end, knowing full-well what will happen.  Why not enjoy the scenery as it passes?

And that’s what I try and do.  Each morning, with my hot pot of green tea, and me.
