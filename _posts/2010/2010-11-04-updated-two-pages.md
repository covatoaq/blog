Updated two pages to reflect recent purchases:  my <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/toys/">Toys</a> page and my <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/toys/wishlist/">Wishlist</a> page.  I have way too much fun sometimes, I've decided.  In other news, I've been struggling to get Git working on my <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/">Webfaction</a> account without success.  I submitted a support question, I hope I get a response back that fixes my problems.  Oy, frustration!
