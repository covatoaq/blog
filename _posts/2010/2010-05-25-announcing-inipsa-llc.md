I've been playing around with web design and development since I was thirteen years old.  That was when I picked up a copy of <em>HTML &amp; CSS For Dummies</em>.  It was also the time of Geocities and HTML3.01.  So many things have changed since then and I've done my best to change with them.

That is why I feel that now is a great time to begin offering my skills and services to everyone.  There's only so many hours in a day that I can spend learning obscure CSS tricks and neat HTML work-arounds.

So, allow me to introduce my web design, web development, general new media service company to you:  <strong>inipsa</strong>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-335 aligncenter" style="border: 0px initial initial;" title="inipsa llc" src="/images/posts/2010/05/logocropped.png" alt="" width="438" height="143" /></p>
It is a word that I made up, one that I hope can find its own meaning as it matures.  So please click over to inipsa's website (which I designed) and see if I can help you.  Let's make something!
