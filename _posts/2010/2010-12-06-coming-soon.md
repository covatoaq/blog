I wish I had something more substantial to show here.  The fact of the matter is I've been working at a fever pace to get what I'm calling version 1.0 of the Best and Worst Project ready.  As I realized tonight, the Python programming language has the uncanny ability to raise my frustration level from 0 to 100 without any effort.  In any event, I'll have that fun website ready to show you soon.  For now sit tight please. :)
