In case you didn’t know Microsoft is releasing a new add-on for the Xbox 360 later this year called Kinect.  <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5563047/what-is-xbox-360-kinect">What is Kinect</a>?  In brief it is a webcam that you attach to your Xbox 360 that is able to track the motion of your body so as to use your body as the controller for games.  What does that mean?  I think it’s easier to learn by example so click on over to <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/06/19/dance-central-preview/">Mashable</a> to see an upcoming Kinect game being played.  Looks really cool to me.
