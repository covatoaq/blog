Very useful tip to keep in mind if you’re in a rush or very impatient.

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/12/twitter-movie/" target="_blank">And Of Course, Here’s The Twitter Movie Trailer</a>
If you’ve caught the first two parodies of the Facebook movie trailer this is a nice third to round it out.  Very funny if you use twitter - and in general.

Sega's Office Pranks - Aaron's Desk
The description on the page sums it up better than anything else, “Aaron went on vacation for 3 weeks and we had some fun with this desk - maybe too much fun.”  Gave me a nice feeling of nostalgia.

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5611778/skip-heavier-weights-for-lighter-repetition-to-build-muscle" target="_blank">Lighter Weights and Longer Repetitions Build More Muscle</a>
Straight from the page, “A study of 15 young men suggests that higher repetition on lighter weights is the route to gaining strength.”  I particularly love the quote on the page, “Rather than grunting and straining to lift heavy weights, you can grab something much lighter but you have to lift it until you can't lift it anymore.”  Gotta love that feeling of sublime lethargy.

<a href="http://kottke.org/10/08/language-between-thought-and-music" target="_blank">thought / music = language (on the radio)</a>
I’m halfway through listening to the new Radiolab episode myself and I can personally attest to it being “characteristically terrific”.  I don’t care who you are or what you’re interested in, I’m very confident you will love the hell out of this podcast.

<a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/13/auto-tune-the-news-comedy-central/" target="_blank">Creators of “Auto-Tune the News” Score Comedy Central Pilot</a>
Great win for ‘the internet’ (can you even say such a thing?).  But seriously, it’s good to know that web produced content isn’t doomed to stay locked into that medium forever.  Good going guys.

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/13/five-viral-rules-video/" target="_blank">Five Rules For How To Make Things Go Viral</a>
If you’re interested in making viral videos then it won’t hurt you to take some advice from Jonah Peretti, CEO of <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a>, a website whose whole business is built around watching and predicting on viral trends on the internet.

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/14/facebook-twitter-foursquare-soap-opera/" target="_blank">If Facebook, Twitter, And Foursquare Were A Part Of Soap Operas</a>
Pretty clever marketing campaign.  A little too overdone in my opinion, but clever nonetheless.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfC-ZHJ4A5U" target="_blank">Freakonomics Trailer</a>
If you read the book then you’ll definitely get a kick out of this trailer.  When I first heard about this movie project I was skeptical, but after watching the trailer, and seeing who the directors are, I’m very excited.  Seeing a book brought to life on film is always wrought with apprehension - the worst fear being that the movie will completely insult the prior book.  This doesn’t look like it’ll be the case.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5614188/woz-will-appear-on-the-big-bang-theory" target="_blank">Steve Wozniak Will Appear On The Big Bang Theory</a>
Title says it all.  Be sure to read the first reader comment, which appears to be from Steve Wozniak himself.  He writes, “I did manage to pass on my wife's suggestion that Sherman should learn to drive by using 6 GPS's at once, as I do.”  That’s something I would love to see both Sherman and Steve performing.
