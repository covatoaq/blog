This is the most exciting news I've read today.  If you grew up in the 90's and had a Nintendo 64 console then you played Goldeneye 007.  I was (and still am) a huge fan of Goldeneye 007.  I even tried to play it a few years after it came out when the next generation consoles were released.  The gameplay was still amazing but the graphics were noticeably hurting.  Fret no more!  Fresh from E3, Nintendo has announced they are refreshing Goldeneye 007 and bringing it with all new graphics to the Nintendo Wii.  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/06/10-kills-with-goldeneye-007-on-the-nintendo-wii.ars">Ars Technica has the full scoop</a> and a picture.  I am so excited!
