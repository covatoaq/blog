Interesting article putting forward a thought unknown to me.  Called <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/8135/">The End of Men</a>, it explores women's rising role in, well, civilization.  There are currently more women in the workforce then men as well as the desire for daughter's has been on a very steady rise.  Have a look for an interesting read.
