If you want to catch Gorillaz live in concert now is your chance.  They’ve just announced their tour dates, so hit up <a href="http://Ticketmaster.com">Ticketmaster.com</a> and see what seats are left!

If you have the focus to finish the article, you’ll learn how to exercise your attention span just like you would any other muscle on your body.  The term neuroplasticity gets thrown about a lot in this post but it seems to have merit in its use.  Get rid of your 140 character-itis and start focusing on novels!
