After buying my Nikon D7000 I decided to sell my first DSLR camera, a Nikon D40.  It wasn't more than a week after my D7000 arrived that I could already see the tell-tale signs that if I didn't sell my D40 fast it would be fated to a long life of dust collecting.

So it was without any further debate that I put up the camera for sale on Craigslist.  I have received a couple of real inquiries however the most common e-mails that I continue to receive are those from Craigslist scammers.

Normally I pay them no heed.  I don't provoke an extension of the exchange through emotion or reason and simply let it lay unanswered in my inbox.

This is the course I am continuing to take however I received one scammer e-mail that I found so novel that I felt forced to share it here.

Following is the e-mail I received from a certain 'dr.shepherd kingsley'.  Any further explanation as to the inventiveness and hilarity of this e-mail is unnecessary.  Please, read and enjoy for yourself (spaces retained for prosperity's sake):
