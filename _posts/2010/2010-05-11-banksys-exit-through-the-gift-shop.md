If you do not know who Banksy is here's a quick summary:  He is a pseudonymous British graffiti artist, internationally famous for his graffiti or "street art" due to its powerful imagery.  A quick gloss over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy" target="_blank">his Wikipedia page</a> shows many of his famous works, some of which you may have seen.

Banksy is involved in a new film that is currently being screened at limited locations.  Although it indirectly serves as a documentary about Banksy the true story is about the film-maker, Thierry Guetta.  Through the story of Guetta the audience is able to gain an understanding of the man as well as who Banksy is.

Personally I have not yet seen this film.  However from reviews I have read and the accolades of friends I have a very small doubt that this film will be a true joy to watch.  As such - if you get the chance - I'm encouraging you to go see it.  And if you do, let me know how you enjoyed it.
