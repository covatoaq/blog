It seems after $75,000 your financial stress is mitigated, with any surplus salary only nominally increasing your overall happiness.  So money can buy (some) happiness.</p>

iPad has some competition.  I can’t wait to try them out.  I hope they’re cheaper.</p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5631692/welcome-to-the-31st-century-nyc" target="_blank">Welcome to the 31st Century, New New York City</a>
Man, if only this came true.  Looks so cool.</p>

Commentary on the page really says it all:  it would be comical if it wasn’t so scary.  Be kind of fun to try that in a nice controlled environment.</p>

I know one friend of mine in particular would make great use of this service.  I think you know who you are.</p>

If I could remove my face I’d dance like that too.</p>

<p>The xx Win the Mercury Prize
Kudos the xx!  You deserved it!</p>

<p><a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/09/google-scribe.html" target="_blank">Google Scribe</a>
Really cool.  Helpful if you got some writer’s block or time to waste.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcm0rG8EKXI" target="_blank">Google Instant with Bob Dylan</a>
Gotta love Google and Bob Dylan, just gotta.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/10/sean-parker-201010?currentPage=all" target="_blank">Meet Sean Parker</a>
He’s the guy who helped make Napster and Facebook what they are now known as.  Intriguing read.</p>

Hilarious commercial.</p>

I feel better about myself now and worse about the clothing companies.  At least my disdain for my waistline has been outsourced.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_38/b4195058423479.htm" target="_blank">The Man Who Makes Your iPhone</a>
Long read but really worth it.  Gives a great and thorough report of how all the gadgets we currently know and love are made so affordable.  What I found most interesting was how this article was written as a PR effort due to last year’s suicides.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_losing_ground_as_users_spend_more_time_on_f.php" target="_blank">Google Losing Ground As Users Spend More Time on Facebook and Yahoo</a>
Seems like Google isn’t forever after.  Just goes to prove once again that the internet is anything but stable and unchanging.</p>

Handy if you have a use for it.</p>
