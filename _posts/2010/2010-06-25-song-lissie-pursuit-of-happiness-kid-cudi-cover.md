Power song, power chords, powerful voice.  Pretty neat summary of Lissie's cover of Kid Cudi's song <em>Pursuit Of Happiness</em>.  Never heard of Lissie before, I don't even know if it's just the name of the lead vocalist or the name of the band.  I don't really care - although I am dreadfully curious - but the song is great.  Thanks to <a href="http://hypem.com">Hype Machine</a> for pointing me in the direction of the song and thank you to <a href="http://thedigitalouthouse.com/post/705614146/lissie-pursuit-of-happiness-kid-cudi-cover">The Digital Outhouse</a> for posting it.  Check out their website for the video of the performance.
