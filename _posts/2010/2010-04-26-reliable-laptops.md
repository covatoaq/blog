I liken 1-year of a computer's life to 25 in human years.  That means that a 3-year old laptop is similar to a 75-year-old person.  Some laptops last more than others, <a href="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20091118/by-manf.jpg">as this chart shows</a>,  based off a report by warranty firm SquareTrade.  So next time you're in the market for a new laptop be aware of their average life expectancies.  For more details check out the full article at <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10400447-1.html">CNET</a>.
