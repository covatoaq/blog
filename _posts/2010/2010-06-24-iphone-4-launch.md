I don't think many people got a lot of work done today.  Between the sweltering weather and the launch of the new iPhone 4, I can only imagine people were doing their best to not get caught slacking off.  I was up at the crack of dawn this morning - 6:30am - and stood outside my local Apple store with my friend for the iPhone 4.

I wasn't even getting the phone, I just figured it'd be a fun thing to do with my buddy who I haven't seen in a long time.  Even though we got there at 6:50am, and the store opened at 7:00am, we were still far back in the Reserved line.  Don't even get me started about how long the non-reserved line was.  I feel sorry for those people.  Except for the people who brought foldable chairs.  Those people I just admire for their smarts.

After waiting in line for an hour we finally got inside and I got my hands on a demo unit.  The first thing that came to my mind after picking up the iPhone 4 was how solid it felt.  And I heard that word tossed around repeatedly:  the iPhone 4 is a <em>solid</em> piece of hardware.   Getting past the great and comforting heft of the device is the screen.  The screen is glorious.  Seriously.  It's so clear that I caught myself squinting at text on the screen - due to habit - and realizing that there was absolutely no need to strain my sight.  The screen is vivid and absolutely gorgeous.

Past that the 'multi-tasking' of iOS 4 was very snazzy.  After you activate the multi-task feature and hold your finger on an app you are presented with the option to exit out of open apps.  This process was much easier than I could have ever imagined.  I was expecting to receive a confirmation box asking if I "was sure I wanted to close that app" but no, iOS calmly and serenely closed the app without any fuss or mess.  So lovely.

Unfortunately I'm stuck on my family's plan on Verizon.  If I could get the iPhone 4 I would, however I am not in the financial position to strike out on my own on AT&amp;T.  I saw the Motorola Droid X is coming out on Verizon in July and it looks really nice.  I'm quite tempted to get it, Verizon iPhone rumors be-damned.  But for now I'll chug along on my BlackBerry Tour, and try and keep my complaints to myself.  For all you out there with the new iPhone 4 I have only one thing to say to you:  <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html#facetime-video">FACETIME!!!</a>
