<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5591576/a-guide-to-meditation-for-the-rest-of-us">A Guide to Meditation for the Rest of Us</a></p>
<p>This is a nice and brief guide teaching you how to meditate.  I find mediation to be useful and extremely helpful in reducing my daily stress levels, and this article is a nice introduction to the subject.  Give it a read if you have a lot of stress in your life and too many things on your mind.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The Top Idea In Your Mind</a></p>
<p>Always a great essayist, Paul Graham, discusses the pitfalls of ruminating on one thought for too long.  A nice read with interesting points worthy of your time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CollegeBinary">Three Minute Philosophy</a></p>
<p>If you’re interested in philosophy at any level check out this YouTube account.  Hosted here are quick and entertaining three-minute-long overviews of famous philosopher’s views.  Although in no ways comprehensive, each video will give you enough material to research that will consume many hours of Wikipedia-ing.  Don’t say you weren’t warned.</p>

<p><a href="http://stereogum.com/443931/mercury-prize-2010-shortlist/news/">Mercury Prize 2010 Shortlist</a></p>
<p>The Mercury Prize is “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Prize">an annual music prize awarded for the best album from the United Kingdom or Ireland</a>”.  This year’s nominations were just released, showcasing a great array of talent over the past year.  My money’s on The xx - their album is absolutely impeccable.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/tabcandy/">Tab Candy: Making Firefox Tabs Sweet</a></p>
<p>If you’re like any internet user that I know then you make heavy usage of tabs.  Aza Raskin, a Firefox developer, has just released a prototype for a new tab management tool.  Click through the link to watch a video showing off its sexiness, and if you’re feeling dangerous click the download link at the bottom of the page to try it out yourself.  Can you say sweet?</p>
