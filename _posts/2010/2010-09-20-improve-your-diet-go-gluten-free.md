<a rel="attachment wp-att-851" href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/09/improve-your-diet-go-gluten-free/gluten-free/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-851" title="gluten-free" src="/images/posts/2010/09/gluten-free-300x219.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="219" /></a>Last night I read an article that has all but convinced me to go gluten-free with my diet.

I've been in the process of reducing the amount of wheat and grain that I eat, going from highly processed white bread to whole wheat.  I’ve also been avoiding unnecessary uses of bread: instead of making a lettuce, tomato, mayo, and turkey sandwich with two slices of bread I now use the lettuce to hold my sandwich together.  That, along with other choice improvements in my diet - such as not eating as much - has been largely easy to maintain and keep.

With these changes I’ve seen incredible weight loss (thirty pounds) and improvements in my overall health.  I feel better, more energized, and overall more healthy.

Who knew diet could be so powerful?<!--more-->

It’s been a year since I first changed my eating habits.  I’ve managed to maintain my weight and keep my diet healthy.  Since it’s been a year of success I figure it can’t hurt to begin pushing for more.  I’ve plataued on my weight loss and although I feel healthy I know I can still stand to lose a few more pounds.

So it was with great serendipity that I ran across this article last night: <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/09/19/paleo-diet-solution/">How to Keep Feces Out of Your Bloodstream (or Lose 10 Pounds in 14 Days)</a>.  The title is gross but the content is awesome.  It goes in depth into the Paleo Diet, one which recommends to avoid eating gluten, “a protein found in wheat, rye oats, and barley.”

I’ve heard this recommendation before, that by-and-large gluten and the foods it's found in isn’t healthy.  However what this article provides is an in-depth scientific explanation of what exactly occurs when gluten is introduced to your digestive system.  It’s discussed with levity and humor, allowing you to breath while enduring a mini-chemistry lesson.

One part that particularly stood out to me was the analogy of poison ivy to grain:
<blockquote>If we compare grains to the strategies listed above, “give a little, get a little,” like the blueberry, or “bugger off,” like the poison oak, we see that grains are much more like poison oak. If a critter eats a grain, that’s it for the grain. That does not mean that the grain goes down without a fight! Grains are remarkably well equipped for chemical warfare.</blockquote>
And how well equipped they are will frighten you...
As an addendum:  In the comments of that article I found a link to a review of a book named <a href="http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/lipid-hypothesis/the-vegetarian-myth/">The Vegetarian Myth</a>.  The article is extremely well written and contains some choice quotes from the book such as:
<blockquote>The truth is that agriculture is the most destructive thing humans have done to the planet, and more of the same won’t save us. The truth is that agriculture requires the wholesale destruction of entire ecosystems. The truth is also that life isn’t possible without death, that no matter what you eat, someone has to die to feed you.</blockquote>
Even if you don’t agree with the content, the information provided is enough to cause more than a few raised eyebrows.  Let me know what you think about these articles in the comments.
