WordPress 3.0, the blogging software that runs this blog, has been officially released to the world - and I have never been more excited.

When I clicked over to the official WordPress blog on Thursday afternoon (which I have been doing every day religiously for the past two weeks) I grew extremely giddy to see the new post read: “<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/">WordPress 3.0 “Thelonious”</a>”.  I was practically jumping in my seat itching to update this blog and begin to play with all the new features that WordPress 3.0 offers.  Unfortunately I had a Psychology quiz in two hours that I had to keep studying for.  I managed to practice a level of self-restraint that I didn’t know I had.

After my Psych quiz was over and I was finally alone at home I upgraded this blog to 3.0.  And then life kicked into overdrive on Friday leaving me with no real time to play until today.

As you can no doubt see I’ve changed the theme of my blog yet again.  I have chosen the new default theme for WordPress 3.0 named <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twenty-ten">Twenty Ten</a>.  It’s a very clean theme:  very easy to read, highly functioning formatting of the website, and it takes advantage of the new features WordPress 3.0 offers.  I am going to perform a few tweaks and twirks (I don’t think that word exists) in the near future to get the theme performing as I want it to.  I think you’ll agree that it’s much easier on the eyes than the previous theme.

So WordPress 3.0 is out and I am just unbelievably excited.  Click through to see a video which highlights some of the best new features WordPress 3.0 has to offer.
