<a href="https://www.23andme.com"></a><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-461" title="Amplification of DNA #2" src="/images/posts/2010/06/dna_lab.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="335" />I love new and cool technologies.  This ranges from the supreme laziness afforded by an <a href="http://store.irobot.com/category/index.jsp?categoryId=3334468&amp;ab=CMS_IRBT_Storefront_051010_mainspot_DD">iRobot Dirt Dog</a> to the awesome laziness afforded by a <a href="http://www.segway.com/">Segway</a>.  Yet these two gadgets pall in comparison to my somewhat fanatical interest in a (relatively) new company called <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andMe</a>:
<blockquote>23andMe's mission is to be the world's trusted source of personal genetic information.</blockquote>
So exactly what does 23andMe offer?  Personal genetic testing for health, disease, and ancestry.  In brief they are a DNA testing laboratory that will give you a very thorough and complete breakdown of your own DNA.  <a href="https://www.23andme.com/howitworks/">Sounds awesome to me</a>.

I've been interested in trying out their services for a while however I cannot honestly rationalize their $500 price for something that I perceive as an awesome (and somewhat practical) luxury.  Maybe I'll give it to myself as a birthday present, or perhaps someone else will.

I recently found a very thorough breakdown and review of a blogger who bought and used 23andMe's services.  Go take a look at <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/review-23andme-dna-testing-for-health-disease-ancestry">Paul's write-up of his experience using 23andMe</a>.  Looks really cool to me, however it still looks to be a luxury purchase.

The future is coming sooner than I can imagine.  I hope the next scientific development is personal body modifications.  I would love to have claws like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(comics)">Wolverine</a>.  I would save so much on shaving costs.
