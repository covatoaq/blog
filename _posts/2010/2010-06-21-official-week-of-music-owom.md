This week I am declaring as my Official Week of Music.  I haven’t posted an album review or highlighted any good artists in a while and I think it’s time to take some time and do just that.  I’ve actually accumulated quite a nice collection of artists and musicians that I am very much itching to write about.  I am no longer restricting myself from writing solely of new artists and albums - there are far too many musicians out there that when they enter my realm of music deserve my attention and adulation.

So without further ado, please enjoy Harry Wolff’s Official Week of Music! :)
