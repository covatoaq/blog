In case you haven’t noticed I am now using a new design.  I changed it this afternoon but I haven’t had a chance to gab about it until now.

This new theme is called <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/blogtxt/">blog.txt</a> and is the hard work of a fellow named <a href="http://scottwallick.com/">Scott</a>.  Thanks Scott for your work!

I hope this design makes for easier reading.  I also hope this design encourages me to make more unique pages instead of just updates.

Whatever the case may be, I hope your Thursday is sunny and cheery.  I just love sunlight. :)
