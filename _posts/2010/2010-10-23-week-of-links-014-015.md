This is a double-featured Week of Links because I'm so late getting it online.  This covers this past week, and the week before that one.

As you can tell these posts are becoming harder to keep on top of, and as such I am going to have to put my 'Week of Links' on hiatus for a little bit.  Life has gotten way too busy and I simply don't have the right amount of time to dedicate to these posts.  Also I want to start focusing on longer term projects.  That means that they'll be less regular updates from me, but hopefully with more things to share when I do update.

For now please enjoy this latest Week of Links.

There's no other company that I'd trust more than Google to begin the push towards driverless cars.  You may be worried that they won't be as safe but I'd wager that by the time a finished product rolls out for mass consumption it'll be safer than cutting a turkey.

From the look of this video I have become bounds more grateful to Michael J. Fox for taking the lead role.  It wouldn't have been the same movie - it would have been much less funny.

Seth Green is the voice of the alien, Paul.  This looks like Men in Block as a pure comedy, without any overtures to blockbuster-dom or action.
