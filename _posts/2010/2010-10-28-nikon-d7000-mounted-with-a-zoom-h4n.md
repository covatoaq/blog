So as you saw in my last post, I have - after long last - my Nikon D7000.  What you may not know is that I also have in my possession a <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4n/">Zoom H4N</a>.  With these two electronic gadgets together I am poised to make great art!

Found two articles while trolling about the internet on how to mount the Zoom H4N onto the Nikon D7000 (and pretty much any DSLR camera to boot).  Seems like through the use of this sweet doohickey, the <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/616257-REG/Pearstone_9041690_Male_Accessory_Shoe_Adapter.html">Pearstone Male Accessory Shoe Adapter w/ 1/4-20 Stud Connector</a>, the Zoom H4N can become mounted snugly and sweetly through the use of the Nikon's flash shoe mount.  Sadly, at the time of this writing, that piece of <del datetime="2011-03-05T00:51:18+00:00">plastic</del> metal is currently unavailable.  Until it is available all I have to look forward to is this picture, an example of a boom mike mounted to a Canon DSLR:

Aaaah, can't wait to play. :)
