I just added a new nifty plug-in to this here blog.  It's called '<a href="http://www.infinite-scroll.com/" target="_blank">Infinite Scroll</a>' and performs the awesome luxury of loading more posts as you scroll down so you don't have to click and wait for a new page to load.  Sometimes I just have fun seeing how far down I can scroll before I get bored.  I'm hoping with this enhancement it'll make reading my blog more enjoyable and fun, encouraging you to stick around for a little longer.  Less frustration is greater pleasure-station!  Let me know if you like it or not, will you?  Or don't, it's ok, I'll keep it anyways.
