They just don’t make ‘em like they used to - if they ever used to make ‘em like that.  I wonder if one of those prototypes ever found its way onto eBay - and what price it fetched.  That’s like a kid gold mine right there.

Always pays to be economical.  Not necessarily in money, but making good use of what you got is always a worthwhile venture.

<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2010/09/jason-schwartzman-ipad-video.html" target="_blank">Jason Schwartzman Introduces The New Yorker iPad App</a>
Gotta love Jason Schwartzman.  Makes me ‘lol’, every time, all the time.

<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/27/rim-introduces-playbook-the-blackberry-tablet/" target="_blank">RIM introduces PlayBook -- the BlackBerry tablet</a>
New competitor to the iPad, and generally a new entrant into the tablet computing sphere.  Looks interesting.  Sports an entirely new OS - not BlackBerry OS.  Definitely has my interest and will be something I can’t wait to try out myself.

<a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/paramount/truegrit/" target="_blank">True Grit - Movie Trailers</a>
Jeff Bridges is awesome.  This film is a remake of the 1969 film that starred John Wayne.  Got him his first oscar.  Let’s see what this Coen brother’s remake can stir up.

<a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1941721" target="_blank">CollegeHumor.com: Hardly Working: Mr. Peepers</a>
Wait for the punchline at the end.  It’ll get you good.

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5649856/gargling-with-salt-water-actually-helps-a-cold-or-cough" target="_blank">Gargling with Salt Water Actually Helps a Cold or Cough</a>
It’s been a folk-recipe for a while, but it’s finally nice to have some science baking up this home-baked recipe.  Lots of people get sick around this time when the season’s are changing, so get your hot salt water brews ready.

<a href="http://kottke.org/10/09/faith-and-knowledge" target="_blank">Faith and knowledge</a>
Who knew that Atheists and Agnostics, on average, know more about religion than those who are actually religious?

<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20100929/00202911209/new-study-shows-texting-bans-may-make-roads-even-more-dangerous.shtml" target="_blank">New Study Shows Texting Bans May Make Roads Even More Dangerous</a>
Did you see this coming?  You probably did because you were so busy texting everyone the news.

<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1692055/why-the-apple-logo-is-like-a-crucifix-or-star-of-david-for-mac-lovers" target="_blank">Apple Logo Is an Agnostic’s Crucifix, Star of David: Study</a>
Information for your noodle.  The Cult of Mac is very real, in a real way that is kind of scary way.

<a href="http://gawker.com/5652426/senate-votes-to-shut-up-loud-tv-commercials" target="_blank">Senate Votes to Shut Up Loud TV Commercials</a>
Thank goodness for this.  Those loud TV commercials have made me literally jump in my seat more than a few times.  It’s at a point now where it’s just rude and crass, never-mind ineffective advertising.

<a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/09/30/verizon-wireless-launches-phone-trade-in-service/" target="_blank">Verizon Wireless launches phone trade-in service</a>
This seems nice on the surface but if you have any ounce of computer savvy you’re better off selling your old phones on Craigslist or eBay.  The deals given on this site are quite comparable to GameSpot’s trade-in value for use video games.  Then again, it is better than nothing.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5651768/this-may-very-well-be-the-first-new-earth" target="_blank">This May Very Well Be the First New Earth</a>
I, for one, am ready to welcome our alien neighbors to the first cross-planetary BBQ.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5651826/inception-ending-revealed-by-sir-michael-caine" target="_blank">Inception Ending Revealed by Sir Michael Caine</a>
This just resolved many outstanding debates.  Kinda sad to see it be so concisely answered, yet relieved that there is a definite answer that can be given.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5652406/google-street-view-invades-antarctica" target="_blank">Google Street View Invades Antarctica</a>
It looks cool down there.  So cool it looks practically freezing.

So if you’re in your car and bored and need something to listen to that it’s funny these are the podcasts you’ll want to have.  I downloaded a few myself, I’ll let you know how they are.
