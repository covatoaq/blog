I should be studying for my Geology mid-term right now.  I’m not, obviously.  

Right now I am going through mid-terms - and they suck.  They take up so much time to study for them - not to mention all the time I spend simply stressing about them.

This is why I haven’t been posting regularly.  Well, I guess I have, but I feel like my post contents have been lacking.  Expect some new music reviews later this week.

On a related-note:  Did you know that Connecticut is an earthquake state?  Did you know that Connecticut existed on the equator during Pangea?  Did you know that there are hundreds of amazing and <em>rock-solid </em>puns one can make in a Geology class?  It’s like a <em>Rocky</em> Horror picture show in there at times!
