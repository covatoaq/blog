<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/el_ramon/4016885758/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-589" title="Berkshire Brewing Company Steel Rail" src="/images/posts/2010/07/bbc-steel-rail-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>Earlier this weekend, from Monday till Thursday, I gave myself a mini-vacation and visited my brother in Boston.  I had a great time while there: I was reminded how much fun city life is and how amazing public transportation is.

While there I also got a chance to hang with a friend from high school.  We met at a bar and shared drinks and stories.  It was fun, and what made it even better was what beer they had available.

Almost a year-ago I tasted what is now my favorite ale.  I’ve been searching high and low to find it but it seems to only be a regional brew.  The beer is called <a href="http://www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com/steel_rail.html">Steel Rail</a> and is made by the <a href="http://www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com/">Berkshire Brewing Company</a>.  It’s a beautiful ale that’s not too heavy, not too soft, and is as sweet as honey while retaining the ale taste.

As written on BBC’s Steel Rail page:
<blockquote>BBC ’s flagship brew, a light colored, medium bodied ale, signature hop flavor and aroma. In the words of renowned beer writer Lew Bryson, Steel Rail EPA is “what the water in heaven oughta taste like”.</blockquote>
