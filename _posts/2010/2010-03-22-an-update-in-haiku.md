Without internet-
Weathered, tired, and busy:
Still obligated.

My interpretation of my haiku: I was without power for the past week.  Although I regained power on Friday my internet access is still down. This makes updating a blog extremely difficult.  In fact I'm posting this from my BlackBerry Tour (thank goodness for 3G).

In any case expect fuller posts when I regain internet access.  Until then I hope you've enjpyed my haiku.

<strong>Update:</strong> Internet access has been restored!  Praise Cablevision!  More posts to follow.
