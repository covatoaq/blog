The latest incarnation of my blogging career, this blog you’re reading right now, was started on January 23rd this year.  By my count that’s a little over two months of blogging with a grand total of 23 posts written so far.

I’m having fun. 

The past times that I have attempted to blog I didn’t last very long.  I think a few may have been online and accessible for over three-months but the frequency of posts were nowhere near as consistent.  Not only that: my enthusiasm hasn’t waned and I am enjoying finding topics to discuss.  Having somewhere to output my overflowing thoughts keeps me productive and sane.  It hurts trying to remember <em>everything</em>.
