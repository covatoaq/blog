Trailer for an upcoming film that focuses on the National Grocers Association’s Best Bagger competition.  And yes that competition exists and is real, and yes I want to compete.

For you photography fans this one’s just plain fun.  Some guy managed to frankenstein a 102-year-old lens onto his brand new Canon DSLR.  The pictures taken are downright spooky.

Entertaining and easy way to kill 10 minutes.  This of course assumes that you want to drop acid and go to the movies.  As the video will show, that isn’t the best idea.

The little plumber’s gotten so old and he doesn’t look a day over thirty.  Go celebrate the many years of Mario and remember your childhood!

This video will induce untold amounts of stress.  Thank goodness I’m not any of those poor souls.

Useful little utility that may come in handy.  If you have a large file you want to send to a friend you can use this website to expedite the process.

Blue and red seem to rule.  It’s kind of sad there aren’t more colors that exist.  Crayola needs to get back to work.

I doubt this will pan out to be true, but it’s still pretty neat to think about.  Maybe we’ll have alien neighbors within our lifetime, although we probably won’t.
