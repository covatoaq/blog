I don't know any other company that has as many fun side-projects as Google does.  From the now defunct <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">Google Wave</a> to the recently updated <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">Google Earth</a> Google seems to always be buzzing with a new toy to share.  Today's newest Google Lab release is no exception.  Allow me to introduce you to <a href="http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/">Google's Body Browser</a>, bringing the power and interactivity of Google Earth to the human body.  <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/12/google-body-browser.html">View this post for more details</a>.
