Let's keep you updated on current music trends:

The Black Keys just released their sixth (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Keys_discography" target="_blank">count 'em</a>) studio album called <em>Brothers</em>.  It's a great album with few flaws.  However the biggest flaw of the album, neatly pointed out by <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14222-brothers/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a>:
<blockquote>If there's one thing that keeps Brothers from jumping the gap between a "very good" album and a "great" album, it's the running time. When it's all said and done, the 15-track set runs almost an hour long</blockquote>
Hardly something to get too upset about it, but sadly the length of the album does detract from its overall quality.

They just released a new video for their track "Tighten Up" which is very funny.  I wish I knew kids who could sing like that.
