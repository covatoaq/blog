It’s very hard to post anything new when there isn’t any power.

My hometown was hit very badly by the storm that passed through New England this past weekend.  There were 80mph winds and lots of rain.  Although I I was out of town and didn’t see the storm myself I saw the aftermath when I arrived home Sunday night.  My entire town is in disarray.  

It was (and still is) very surreal.  It is also an extremely humbling reminder of Mother Nature’s tremendous power.

I’ll keep you updated.
