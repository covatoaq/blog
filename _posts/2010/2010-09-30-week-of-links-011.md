Looks pretty spiffy.  I don’t think I would take this over my iPad but it definitely shows what future Android tablet computers may be like.  Something that definitely has my interest.

This just brings a smile to my face.  Business is as business does, eh?

In case you were wondering.

Although I find this news interesting it somewhat irks me that on any given day a new scientific report will discredit a previous one.  This isn’t to say I don’t appreciate the scientific process, but it is to say that I wish we would reach a ‘final draft’ version of some pieces of information.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5566261/delicious-alcoholic-cocktails-under-the-microscope" target="_blank">This Is How Your Drinks Look Under the Microscope</a>
This is how you get drunk - on a microscopic level.

<a href="http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=145986" target="_blank">Say Hello to CAPTCHAs as Advertising</a>
This is so brilliant.  So flippin brilliant.  Why hasn’t this been thought of before?  This made me slap myself and wonder why it’s taken this long.

<a href="http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=33956" target="_blank">The Full Live-Action Pokemon Trailer</a>
Fan-made trailer.  Looks pretty cool, aside from the animations which look like they could have stood a few upgrades.  All-in-all pretty spiffy.

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/19/facebook-is-secretly-building-a-phone/" target="_blank">Facebook Is Secretly Building A Phone</a>
Do you believe it’s true?  Only time will tell.  And if time says it’s true then you can claim you knew it before anyone else.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5644966/this-is-how-much-we-text-now" target="_blank">This Is How Much We Text Now</a>
And yet we still pay through the nose to use such a simple technology.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5645397/this-is-how-moses-actually-parted-the-waters" target="_blank">This Is How Moses Actually Parted the Waters</a>
Science and religion.  Always a fun pair.

Goodbye ol’ blue.  You will be missed.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzfEH0UPEBo" target="_blank">New “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” Trailer </a>
Sweet deal guy.  I’m glad they’re not delaying the second one a year later and only about six months.  Thank goodness for that.  I’m going to have to re-read the plot outline on Wikipedia on what happens in this book, it’s been a while since I read it.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/28curious.html?_r=1" target="_blank">To Enhance Flavor, Just Add Water</a>
I love water.  No - seriously - I love water.

World's Scariest Job
Did you get vertigo watching this too?

<a href="http://kottke.org/10/09/where-good-ideas-come-from" target="_blank">Where Good Ideas Come From</a>
I’ll be honest, I haven’t watched this video yet.  But I’ve heard good things.  I’ll watch it eventually.  Let me know if you like it.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5643882/recursive-pizza-topped-with-smaller-pizzas-requires-advanced-degree-to-eat" target="_blank">Recursive Pizza Topped With Smaller Pizzas Requires Advanced Degree to Eat</a>
This is pretty sweet.  I would love to figure out how to do this myself.  I know my brother - a pizza nut - would love to try this.

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/23/mozilla-phone/" target="_blank">Forget The Facebook Phone, Here’s Mozilla Seabird — An Open Web Concept Phone</a>
We can dream, can’t we?

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5646941/how-to-build-the-ultimate-beats-per-minute-optimized-running-playlist" target="_blank">How to Find Your Music's BPM to Build a Great Exercise Playlist</a>
Nice utility that may come in handy at some point.

<a href="http://splitsider.com/2010/09/every-single-episode-of-snl-is-coming-to-netflixs-watch-instantly/" target="_blank">Every Single Episode of SNL Is Coming to Netflix’s Watch Instantly</a>
How flippin fantastic is that?  This is practically what streaming was invented for: shows with big catalogs that don’t necessarily need to be owned, yet ones that would be accessed occasionally.

<a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/24/google-pizza/" target="_blank">Google’s Extremely Bizarre Pizza Video</a>
The title can’t fully capture the extreme bizareness of this video.  I watched the whole thing and don’t regret it - despite the time suck that it was.  I feel bad for that guy who repeatedly said ‘pizza’ throughout the 10 minutes.  Wow.

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5644256/make-a-portable-green-screen-on-the-cheap" target="_blank">Make a Portable Green Screen on the Cheap</a>
Good to know, right?

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5647279/nine-restaurants-from-the-future" target="_blank">Nine Restaurants Sent Back From the Future to Destroy Us (With Good Eats)</a>
I would love to try out the restaurant with the tracks that the meals are brought out on.  That’s so cool.  Meals on wheels personified.

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5645396/de+grease-your-laptop-with-a-mr-clean-magic-eraser" target="_blank">De-Grease Your Laptop with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser</a>
I’m going to do this as soon as I can.  My laptop is clamoring for a cleaning.

And that’s it for this week!  Hope you enjoyed it! :)
