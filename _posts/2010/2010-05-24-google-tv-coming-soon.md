This is fresh news from last week:  Google announced an upcoming product called Google TV.  It's Google's try to make TV better.  Imagine watching a TV show and wanting to look up an actor name:  you activate Google TV that hovers over your show and lets you search for the actor's name and then go to his imdb.com page or Wikipedia page.  Simple, fun, and hopefully useful.  Check out <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5543822/what-is-google-tv" target="_blank">Gizmodo's thorough overview</a> and then watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diTpeYoqAhc" target="_blank">Google's promotional video</a> that'll show you how awesome Google TV may be.
