Look at what clever thing I did that made me feel so smart:

I’ve missed having powerful speakers in my room for a long time.  Until today I’ve been subsisting on this to produce music in my room:

So in summary, thank god for 1/8” to 1/4” adapters and male-to-male 1/8” cords.  Thank the musical gods.
