For a little while Iâ€™ve been curating and saving a list of thoughts and ideas that I felt were important enough to remember.  This list most definitely has pieces of information that you already know, however I felt it was important to have them set down and saved.

I actually mediated on what to name this list for a good two weeks:  while driving around I would think on what would make for a good title.  I went through many variations and revisions until finally settling on one name, ultimately deciding to call this list <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/vital-information-for-western-civilization/">Vital Information for Western Civilization</a>.

I hope to update this list and improve upon this first draft.  If you have any comments or additions you think should be added please let me know.  Until then, enjoy reading:
