December is a busy month.  Seriously.  I haven't felt like I have had a moment to myself this entire month.  The pace of everything, including the speed of the wind, has picked up with such ferocity that I am often left dizzy and bewildered.  

That's definitely been the word of the month for me:  Bewilderment.  December is most certainly a Bewilder-beast month that will stop at nothing until I am left numb from over-exertion.

I wanted to have my side-project, Best and Worst Project, finished this week, which has unfortunately slipped, thanks to December.

I wanted to have a new video up this week on my youtube page, which has unfortunately slipped, thanks to December.

I wanted to stay warm and avoid catching a cold this week, which has unfortunately slipped, thanks to December.

But thanks to work and the free flu shot I received I don't have a cold.  Thank December for that.

Everything else December?  Go bewilder yourself.
