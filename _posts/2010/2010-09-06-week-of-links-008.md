<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/science/31profile.html?_r=1" target="_blank">Think the Answer’s Clear? Look Again - Medical Statistics</a>
Who knew medical statistics could be so interesting?  I certainly didn’t.  Did you know Academy Award winners are likely to live longer?  Interesting stuff in this here article.  Have a read.

<a href="http://stereogum.com/486932/arcade-fire-we-used-to-wait-video/news/" target="_blank">Arcade Fire – “We Used To Wait” Video</a>
You’re going to need Google’s Chrome browser for this to work right, but when it does it’s pretty damn cool.  For their music video Arcade Fire has called on technology know-hows at Google to create an experience that is custom tailored to each and every one of us.  Pretty damn cool.  Go look!

<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/whats-the-definition-of-obsolete-check-online-20100830-147bv.html" target="_blank">What's the definition of 'obsolete'? Check online</a>
This is sad because it marks the end of an era.  For a variety of reasons the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> may no longer print and sell its 20-volume printed edition - it’s just cheaper to keep it online.  At least you can score one for saving trees.

<a href="http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=33674" target="_blank">Blizzard says they're waiting for James Cameron for their Starcraft Film</a>
I’d go see it.  If there’s anyone who could pull off a Starcraft movie, James Cameron is certainly one.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5627530/the-future-of-screens-circa-2014" target="_blank">The Future of Screens, Circa 2014</a>
Watching this video I can’t help but pause and reflect at how advanced our current technology already has become - and how easy it will be to create the technology exhibited in this video.  Sure it may not be cost-effective to mass produce these devices yet, but the technology is certainly already available.  Absolutely amazing.

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5627456/unhearit-gets-that-song-out-of-your-head-with-a-catchy-new-one" target="_blank">Unhearit Gets that Song Out of Your Head with a Catchy New One</a>
This is a cool idea for a website although some of the songs played to help you ‘unhearit’ are decidedly worse than what is playing in my head.  Ah well.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc0mxOXbWIU" target="_blank">Cee Lo Green - FUCK YOU (Official Video)</a>
This video has already gone viral and with good reason: it’s hilarious.  Definitely NSFW but wait till you get home to watch - it’s very much worth it.  Great song and video

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5628375/stephen-hawking-big-bangs-happen" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking: "Big Bangs Happen"</a>
I really love the simplicity of this quote.  Covers all lose ties as neatly as they are frayed.  Awesome.

<a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/39935-radiohead-approved-fan-shot-concert-movie-released/" target="_blank">Radiohead-Approved, Fan-Shot Concert Movie Released</a>
If you’re a big Radiohead fan - which I am - then you should definitely check out this video.  Radiohead fans took and compiled hand-held footage of a Radiohead concert and it came out looking really good.  Go look!

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5628396/the-basic-guide-to-troubleshooting-common-windows-pc-problems" target="_blank">The Basic Guide to Troubleshooting Common Windows PC Problems</a>
I haven’t dug through all the information contained in this link, but if you are a Windows novice I heavily recommend you take a few minutes to peruse through this article.  From the looks, it’s jam-packed with awesome information.

<a href="http://kottke.org/10/09/web-packets-in-flight" target="_blank">Web packets in flight</a>
Ever wondered what was going on behind the scenes when you watch a YouTube video?  This video provides a nice and easy-to-follow animation of the technology that powers and operates YouTube.  Check it out.

<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5629532/freak-out-your-coworkers-with-google-docs-konami-code" target="_blank">Freak Out Your Coworkers With Google Docs Konami Code</a>
You have to do this inside of an open Google Doc window, but it’s really funny once you see what happens.  I plan to do this as soon as I can to an unsuspecting friend.
