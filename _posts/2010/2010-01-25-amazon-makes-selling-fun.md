Right now I’m surrounded by old textbooks.  

Textbooks from the previous four years of my college life.  Some textbooks I don’t think I ever opened.  Some textbooks I think I used at most three times.  Some textbooks make me recoil with bad memories of professors (who weren’t the greatest teacher [but I may not have been the greatest student either]).

So what’s a college student to do with so many old textbooks - gathering dust and taking up space?

Sell them on Amazon Marketplace!

This has been on my to-do list for the past two weeks and this night the time was finally right.  I did some brief reading over the past two weeks about how Amazon Marketplace works -- gauging the level of difficulty and time it would take.

There was no way I could predict how easy Amazon makes it to sell things.  It’s so easy it’s almost fun.

Almost fun - this post was written 3/4’s of the way through listing all the textbooks.  It’s super easy, but also super monotonous and this is a nice break.

So, to all my college and ex-college friends out there:  If you have no more use for your college textbooks and have a free evening: List your books!  Aint nothing so sweet as making money.  Except lollipops.  They’re sweeter.  (It’s because of the sugar.)  

[<strong>Update 1</strong>:  Less than 24 hours from listing my textbooks one has already sold!  That was time well spent...]
