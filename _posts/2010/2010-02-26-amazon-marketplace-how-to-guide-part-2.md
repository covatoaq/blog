This is part 2 of my How-To Guide for Selling your stuff on Amazon Marketplace.  It's an easy way to make a buck - much easier than eBay.  For Part 1 of my guide click on this <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/02/amazon-marketplace-how-to-guide-part-1/">link right here</a>.
<h2>How to Ship Your Items On Amazon Marketplace</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
	<li>If you have set your notification settings up then you will receive an e-mail when someone buys your item.  To set that up log into your Seller Account and from the main page click on “Notification Preferences” underneath the “Settings” category.</li>
	<li>On the Notification Preferences page make sure you receive an e-mail for the “Sold, Ship Now!” option.</li>
	<li>When you receive the e-mail that your item has sold log into your Seller Account.</li>
	<li>Click on “View your orders” underneath the “Manage your Orders” category.</li>
	<li>From this page you will see the item that just sold.  On the far right of that items row click on “Print packing slip”.</li>
	<li>Take the printed packing slip and your item to your preferred shipping service and ship it!  I prefer USPS’ Flat rate packages for shipping books but do what you are used to.  Remember:  Depending on the shipping service the buyer requests is how much shipping credit (money) that Amazon will give you.  For domestic standard shipping with books Amazon credits you $3.99.  Amazon has a complete <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161252">Shipping Rates and Credits table</a> for your reference.</li>
	<li>After you have shipped your item go back to the “View your orders” page from step 4.</li>
	<li>Now you must confirm that you have shipped your item.  Enter in the shipping service you used and the tracking number if you have one.</li>
	<li>That’s it!</li>
