I am writing this post in the middle of my two weeks of Finals.  Really there's only one week of Finals but I have some due this week so I'm calling it two.  As such don't expect many updates until Thursday when my semester is complete.  And if I am posting then I am neglecting my studies (just like now).  To tide you over have a look at a robot that can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI06lujiD7E" target="_blank">balance itself perfectly</a> on a ball.  It's pretty neat.   <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5528165/a-robot-with-supernatural-balance">[source]</a>
