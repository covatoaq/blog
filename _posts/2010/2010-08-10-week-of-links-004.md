Sorry about the delay for getting this post online.  It’s been a wickedly busy week and I figured it be better to take my time with this post rather than rush it.  Lots of great goodies for you here.  Read on, and enjoy!

Look at the paint job on that thing.  And forget about indigestion, this thing is farting fire.

Last words from the lips of famous and talented authors.  Anton Chekhov’s last words make me chuckle and sigh.

If you’ve ever wondered how the internet works, what hardware and software goes into its’ being, then click on over to this great infographic that gives you a wonderful overview of the inner workings of the Internet.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHps2SecuDk" target="_blank">The Oregon Trail - Official Trailer</a>
If you grew up in the 90s then you probably crossed paths with the old Mac game, Oregon Trail.  It’s a game that was as informative as it was funny.  Here someone made a faux-trailer for a movie based on the video game, and boy it it funny.

Remember the old Road Runner cartoons?  Seems like it may be making a comeback - in 3D.  I wasn’t sold on the idea until I watched the small preview clip.  Seems to retain its old spirit, and so long as it does that then I’m all for it.

<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2010/08/04/40-billionaires-sign-the-gates-buffett-giving-pledge/" target="_blank">More Billionaires Sign the Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge</a>
This is quite possibly the most amazing thing that has happened recently:  Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have gotten at least 30 billionaires to sign a pledge to give away more than half their fortunes.  Although in no way binding, this is an awesome and great step forward for philanthropy as we know it.

Sad knows for all the geeks out there:  Google has decided to halt all work on Google Wave.  One can only speculate what Google Wave could have become had Google continued work on it.  At least we can take comfort that all the progress and cool technology made for Google Wave will continue to live on in other products like Google Docs.  Long Live Google Wave!  We knew you too late!
