Last night I stayed up way too late to finish putting together my second compilation of footage from my Nikon D7000.  The previous one I rushed to finish, leaving it in many ways incomplete and not up to my satisfaction.

This new video that I put together uses the same source material as the my first video, however it is arranged in a more coherent manner.  Through my use of Final Cut Pro's subclips I was able to put together the video with much greater ease and less frustration.  The next step for me is to start playing with transitions a bit more - I've hardly delved into that library of effects.

P.S.:  I ask you to click through because I don't like having Flash content on my main page.  I find it to be a drag.
