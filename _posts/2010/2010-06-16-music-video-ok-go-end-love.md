<p>OK Go have made quite a few famous viral videos over the years.  Their previous video featured a large and awe-inspiring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg machine</a>.  I didn’t like the tune so much but the video was more than worth a watch.</p>

<p>OK Go is back with a new video.  This time around they’re messing with the speed of time.  From an article at Discover Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>The fastest we go is 172,800x, compressing 24 hours of real time into a blazing 1/2 second. The slowest is 1/32x speed, stretching a mere 1/2 second of real time into a whopping 16 seconds. This gives us a fastest to slowest ratio of 5.5 million. If you like averages, the average speed up factor of the band dancing is 270x. In total we shot 18 hours of the band dancing and 192 hours of LA skyline timelapse – over a million frames of video – and compressed it all down to 4 minutes and 30 seconds! Oh and don’t forget, it’s one continuous camera shot.</blockquote>

<p>Really impressive and cool video.  Gives me some neat ideas of how these time-manipulations could be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>Despite the video being one of OK Go’s finest I am very much in agreement with the song.  I’ve never given an OK Go album a listen - most their material I heard from their singles and videos.  However their song <em>End Love</em> is deliciously groovy.</p>

<p>Have a watch and a listen.</p>
