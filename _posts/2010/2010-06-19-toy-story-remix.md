In case you didn’t know:  Toy Story 3 has just been released this weekend.  I’m gearing up to watch it for Father’s Day tomorrow and I’m expecting it to be great.  I’ve already heard so many great things about it: I’ve read so many <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_3/">reviews that have given it a 10/10</a>.  I just hope I don’t set my expectations so impossibly high that all I can expect back is disappointment.  In any case, Pogo is back with a remix of Toy Story audio mixed with an ambient background track.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbD5ke7xqww">Check it out on YouTube</a>.
