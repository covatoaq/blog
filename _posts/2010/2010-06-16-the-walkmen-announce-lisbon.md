Happy news for me!  One of my favorite bands, <a href="http://www.marcata.net/walkmen/">The Walkmen</a>, have just announced their new album.  Titled <em>Lisbon,</em> it is set to come out September 14.  <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/39168-the-walkmen-announce-new-album/">Pitchfork has the full scoop</a>.
