As we are prone to do we had many different sessions of playing and enjoying music.  We practiced and performed a make shift harmonization of The Postal Service’s song <em>Such Great Heights</em> and got down and bluesy to The Beatles’ <em>Rocky Raccoon</em>.

In the midst of the night a friend and I began discussing what each of us look for when we listen to music.

The first thing I pay attention to when I listen to a song is its timbre, i.e. the <em>feel</em> of the song.  I attune my ear to the manner in which the song is delivered and can usually tell if I like a song within the first ten-seconds of hearing it.

When I’ve decided that the timbre is of favorable quality I then turn my attention to more technical aspects of the song-making process.  I isolate the melody and chorus, breaking down how they’re arranged and attempting to discern why I like them.  After rolling them around my head a couple of times I then try to isolate other layers of the song, mentally isolating background pads from guitar leads to see how and why they work.  The last part of a song that I pay attention to is the lyrics.  I’ll notice the way the lyrics are sung quickly but I don’t focus on their actual content until the end.

My friend began telling me how he listens to music.  He focuses on the technical aspects of a song first and works his way from there - ending on its timbre.  Usually he and I agree on what songs we enjoy listening to but every so often there’s a diversion.  Maybe it’s due to the way we listen to music, or maybe its just taste.

All I know is that music plays a very large part in my life.  No matter how I listen, I know that I love <em>to</em> listen.
