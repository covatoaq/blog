Was doing some research on git today.  I've been using SVN a lot at work and was looking to start using SVN at home for my personal projects but, per a reminder by a co-worker, I set my eyes back to git and have just been doing some reading onto its capabilities and use.  I've found that git is a very handsome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" target="_blank">revision control system</a>.  (If you'd like for me to go into more detail on what a revision control system is, why it's useful, and why it's awesome, just leave a comment asking for a post and I'll do so.)

Starting with <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/introductory-guide-to-git-version-control-system/">Six Revisions introductory guide to git</a>, I felt like I had a good base understanding of what git is (as compared to other revision control systems).  From that article I branched out onto Google and came across this gittutorial Manual page hosted by kernel.org.  After going through the entire tutorial, and performing the actions described, I feel pretty confident that I'll be able to start using git without any problems.

So no more worrying about losing a version of a file after I experiment with something else.  This is going to make my web development life tons easier.
