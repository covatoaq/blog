<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/17/text-messaging-infographic/" target="_blank">The Rise of Text Messaging</a>
This page contains a neat infographic on how text messaging has progressed since its inception in 1992.  For many texting has been around since the dawn of time, however I can still remember my parents chiding me for sending too many texts.  We’ve come such a long ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://videogum.com/212852/joaquin-phoenixs-im-still-here-trailer/movies/trailer/" target="_blank">Joaquin Phoenix’s I’m Still Here Trailer</a>
Don’t know if you remember that period of time when it seemed that actor Joaquin Phoenix had lost his mind.  Well in case you forgot, he’s made a mock/documentary about his escapades with avant-garde art.  Trailer looks weird as sin.</p>

This is just all kinds of interesting and awesome.  Click through to the link to watch the trailer.  Really, really cool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jaI1XOB-bs" target="_blank">Black Swan Trailer</a>
Upcoming movie from Darren Aronofsky (director of The Wrestler and Requiem of a Dream).  Stars Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis and looks absolutely riveting.  Of note is that Aronofsky didn’t write the screenplay for this movie, something that he usually does alongside directing.</p>

To say I want this is an understatement.  Sexy time is now.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5616003/yogile-simplifies-group-photo-sharing" target="_blank">Yogile Simplifies Group Photo Sharing</a>
I’ve been wanting something like this for a long time.  Yogile allows you to create a photo gallery that allows anyone to add to.  Perfect for those events where multiple camera’s are taking pictures and you need to get all the pictures together.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet light reveals how ancient Greek statues really looked
This is perhaps the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time, something that you really want to take a look at.  Just because it’s ancient history doesn’t mean it still ain’t the coolest thing you’ve seen this week.  I would have never thought to guess that the old Greek statues were even painted, I thought they were purposely and stoically left plain.  In a word, awesome.</p>

<p>James Patterson Tops List Of Highest Earning Authors
In case you’re curious, this is the list of the highest earning authors.  Top three are James Patterson, Stephenie Meyer (of Twilight), and Stephen King - in that order.  J.K. Rowling rounds out the list at number 10.</p>
