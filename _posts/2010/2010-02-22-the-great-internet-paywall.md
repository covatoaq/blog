<p>On Sunday I got a funny idea for a website.  Inspired by The Wall Street Journal’s decision to require users to pay to access their articles I created <a href="http://harrywolff.com/paywall/">this satirical website</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing there works, it’s just a static page, but I’d be seriously curious how many people would pay to “access the internet.”  I think it’s all hilarious - to access that webpage you already need to be accessing the internet.  The irony kills me.</p>
