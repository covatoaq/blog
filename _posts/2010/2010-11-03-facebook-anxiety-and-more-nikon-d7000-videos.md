I read a post the other day that <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/28/facebook-activity-study/">links posted to Facebook in the morning</a> perform the best, i.e. they are more prominently displayed on other friends' news feeds, thus getting seen more and subsequently (it is the hope) being clicked on the most.  For the past two days I've been more or less consumed by this factoid, halting myself from writing and posting a post because it's past 10am EST.

Well shit, that's ruined at least two good posting impulses I've had in the past few days.  All because of this little dirty factoid.  

So it finally came to me today, even though it's past 10am, to just fricken write about how I can't get this factoid out of my head.  It has wormed its way through my consciousness and given me a weird form of writer's block that would not exist more than five years ago.

It's amazing how much can change in such a short amount of time.

I want to write more about my new camera, the Nikon D7000, the <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/10/nikon-d7000-mounted-with-a-zoom-h4n/">flash mount for my Zoom</a> that I ended up buying, and the videos that I'm putting together and posting on my YouTube account.  (Find my YouTube account on the right rail, over click on this link:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hswolff">Harry Wolff's YouTube Channel</a>.)

So if you clicked on the YouTube link you'll see I posted two vides taken with my new camera.  I'm in the process of re-editing the 'Demo Reel' clip, putting in a little bit more example shots as well as cleaning up the video narrative.  I hope to have that out by the weekend, but hopefully/probably sooner.

Also I've decided to make the posting frequency on this blog be as random as I am.  I feel stupid stating this here because I know I'm damning myself to future transgressions of posting behavior, however that is just what I do, so I'm doing it.  Be sure to sign up so you can get updates when I post.  That is, if you like me.  And even if you don't like me sign up to be updated.  I like you even if you don't like me.  And as the old saying goes, there's not a whole lot of a difference between love and hate.
