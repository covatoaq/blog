<p>On Saturday I woke up before the birds began singing to wait in line at my local Apple store for the launch of the new iPad.  I was there for two reasons.  The first was to buy an iPad - which I did and now own.  A full review will be posted as soon as possible but for now let me say this: this device is great fun.  And before you make up your mind about whether you like it or not let me offer one piece of advice:  go to your local Apple store and play with it for five minutes.  That’s truly the only way to get an accurate idea of whether this device is for you.</p>

<p>The second reason why I was at the Apple store was to film a promotional video for the Niente Peaches comedy group’s upcoming film <em>Charlie Christ: The Gospel According to Fools.</em> I have recently joined this ensemble as Director of Marketing.  We’re in the last round of filming and the film should be complete sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>At the Apple store this past Saturday we got a lot of footage and last night my friend Ernie finished compiling the video.  It’s now on YouTube and I’ve posted it below for easy viewing.</p>

<p>After you finish watching the entire thing I’d like you to remember this note:  The last scene <em>was</em> acting.  I was told to perform and there you see my Oscar-worthy performance.</p>

<p>Video found after the link.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
