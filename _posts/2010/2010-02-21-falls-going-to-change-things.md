Last Thursday I received some awesome news.  Let me back up first: Currently my full-time job is a college student.  I am finishing my college career and was expecting to graduate in December of this year.  Last Thursday I met with my guidance counselor and found out that I can graduate this summer.  I’ve been on Cloud 9 since.

That was until I began thinking about what I was going to do this Fall.  I’ll be a college-grad, living at home, and without a job.  I’ve never encountered this before.  Any other times I’ve had off were in-between college semesters.  This is the first time I’ll be without school - and it’s a weird feeling.

Best thing I can do is to live today as today.  If I get to thinking too far in the future I end up tripping over myself in my haste to force the future to become the now.

I’ve been working on an original song.  When I get it better polished expect for it to be published here.  I’m eager to get feedback but frightened of harsh criticism.

Disregarding everything above: here’s an up-and-coming band whose going on tour soon with the Antlers.  They call themselves <a href="http://www.barsuk.com/bands/phantogram">Phantogram</a> and they got good grooves.  My music doesn’t sound anything like this (yet) but I still love these sounds.  Hit play and give them a listen.
