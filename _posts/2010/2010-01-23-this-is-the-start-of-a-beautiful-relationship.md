Last time I counted I’ve been the unsuccessful creator and successful destroyer of three blogs.

One I began and stopped in High School (shouts to my co-blogging friends from back-then).

The second blog was made mostly in private.  I’m not sure if a blog needs to be public to be considered a ‘true’ blog, but this one was updated ad-hoc between the first and second blog.

The third blog I began about six months ago.  It was off to a good start - ultimately stunted by my continuous state of mental flux.

So let’s go for broke.  This is blog #4.

I’d make a promise and say, “This blog will be online until Skynet takes over!”  But hell - promises aint worth their weight in sand nowadays.

In any case, here we go.  Let’s have some fun. :)
