What a lovely calm day.  No visitors to my site today and I am quite pleased.  Today has been utterly relaxing and I can't wait for the nightfall to bring fun.

I had a thought today while scratching my dog:  Do dogs itch?  Thus explaining why they like being scratched?  Or do they like the human connection?  I'd be interested to see an experiment that let dogs have access to a machine that let them scratch themselves at will.  Would they prefer the machine scratching over human scratching?
