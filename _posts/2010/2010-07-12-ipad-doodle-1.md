Recently I’ve been playing around with the drawing apps on my iPad more frequently.  I’ve come up with some doodles that I like, and some that I don’t.  The one’s that I like are simple, but retain a degree of poignance that I feel can be shared.

Here’s one I drew over the weekend.  Let me know what you think.
