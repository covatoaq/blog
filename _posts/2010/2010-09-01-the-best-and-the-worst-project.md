A little while ago I <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/05/the-best-and-the-worst-list-of-all-time/" target="_blank">wrote a post</a> that had an idea for a list of ‘best things’ and ‘worst things’.  It was a quirky idea based off then-recent observations of my over-use of the phrases ‘the best!’ and ‘the worst!’.

What’s interesting to me is the fact that those phrases haven’t gone away.  Although the frequency in which they’re said has decreased, they seem to have crept into my daily way of talking - and I’m not alone.  I see and hear other people using those phrases - ‘the best’ and ‘the worst’ - all the time now, leading me to believe that I’m not unique in their use and far from being their creator.

For those who know me I am a computer enthusiast and programmer.  I have recently decided it was time for me to learn a new programming language, namely <a href="http://python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>.  I’ve been reading a lot of theoretical books on how to program Python, however there is something that can’t be taught without actually programming.

To that end, the past two weeks I have taken to my computer terminal and created my first Python program.  Its use is directly related to what I was talking about in the beginning of this post: a list of ‘best’ things and ‘worst’ things.  I used the web framework <a href="http://web2py.com/" target="_blank">web2py</a> along with general Python code to create my application.

Despite the late nights of code that frustrated me to no end, I had a great time learning Python and web2py, along with programming in general.  I may write an additional post detailing my experience of delving into the Python and web2py world of web-based programming, but that will come later rather than sooner.

Right now it is my extreme pleasure to introduce you to a very early alpha version of my web-application.  It’s hosted on Google’s App Engine for free, which is awesome, and is still far from complete.  Let’s count this version as version 0.5.

Without further ado:
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bestandworstproject.appspot.com/" target="_blank">The Best and the Worst Project</a></h3>

<strong>Update</strong>:  My friend on Facebook reminded me to explain some things that I forgot to mention.  She asked "<em>so, is it basically like a greatest hits compilation, of best and worst stuff? do we write in stuff that we think is the best/worst, or phrases containing those words?</em>".  My response was as follows:
<blockquote>Basically you write your entry, and end it with 'the best' or 'the worst' depending on the type. This release is a very early version, mainly just to preview the technology behind it. Later one's will be prettier and contain more explanation. Also I am not going to save anything entered or created on this version...so have fun and play, click the voting arrows, and let me hear more feedback!</blockquote>
