<a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/" target="_blank">Today iOS 4.2 was officially released.</a>  This brings the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad all up to date with the latest version of iOS.  This is particularly exciting news for me with my iPad.  The biggest change I'm welcoming with this update is multi-tasking on my iPad.  Before this update it was cumbersome and difficult to switch between apps.  It required exiting the current app, going to the home screen, and then opening the new app.  With iOS 4.2 I can be in one app, double click the home button, see a list of previously opened apps, click on the app and switch directly to its window.  If you haven't upgraded your iDevice yet I heartily suggest you do so now.
