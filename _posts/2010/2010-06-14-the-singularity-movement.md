The Singularity movement believes that at some point in the nearer-than-you-think future “human beings and machines will so effortlessly and elegantly merge that poor health, the ravages of old age and even death itself will all be things of the past.”  It has a bunch of notable people involved such as the co-founder’s of Google and famed inventor Ray Kurzweil who says he “conquered diabetes decades ago by changing what he ate and later reprogramming his body with supplements. He currently takes about 150 pills a day and has regular intravenous procedures.”  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/business/13sing.html?pagewanted=all">The New York Times has a big six-page article</a> all about the movement so go have a read.
