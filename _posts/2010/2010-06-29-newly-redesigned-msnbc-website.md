Uhm, have you seen the newly redesigned <a href="http://MSNBC.com">MSNBC.com</a> website?  It’s nothing less than amazing.  For the first time in my life I may actually be inclined to read and use a news website as its designed.  For as long as I can remember I would find articles linked to from aggregating websites, saving me the time from hunting through the websites own confusing website layout.  And damn, I’m dying to know what web technologies they’ve put to use, especially with the navigation icons next to the scrollbar.  So cool.
