I wish I could write more right now but I'm running low on the amount of time I can use for myself this morning to write an update for you.  That last sentence was meant to be wrong and convoluted and lengthy and awkward.  Later tonight I will definitely have either an update or be ready to show either a piece of software I've been working on or a song I've been working on.  Whatever event occurs, rest assured I have not been forgetting to keep you, my faithful, dear, beloved, reader in the loop of my happenings.  Because I know how fickle I can be, I am writing this to rest your fears of my perceived flightiness and readiness to leave without notice.  I will be back!
