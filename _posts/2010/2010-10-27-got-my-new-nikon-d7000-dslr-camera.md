My new camera - my birthday present to myself - has finally arrived.  I got the call right before my lunch break at work today, ran down to the store, and am now the proud owner of a Nikon D7000.  I got a chance to play with it for a little while to day, but not nearly enough time.  I hope to start experimenting with its capabilities much more in the near future.  I'll let you know my progress, including showing off anything cool that I create.  Yay birthday present to myself!  (p.s: I got one of two Nikon D7000's shipped to my local camera store.  Woohoo!) (p.p.s: That picture in the heading is one of my first taken with the camera :) )
