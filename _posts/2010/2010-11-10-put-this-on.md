Just got turned onto a new web series called <a href="http://putthison.com/" target="_blank">Put This On</a>.  It's hosted by two hip dudes Jesse Thorn and Adam Lisagor, and as clearly stated on their homepage, Put This On is 'A Web Series About Dressing Like a Grownup'.  It doesn't hurt that it's also entertaining to watch.
