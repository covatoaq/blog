This post marks two awesome achievements for me: I have, since last Thursday, been a college graduate, and this is my blog's 100th post.  I was going to post about my graduation on Thursday - when it happened - but I delayed it so that it would strike on the 100th post.  For a while I was worried it would take me a while to get to this 100th post, and I'd have to make my college graduation post land on post 99, but I managed to make it work. 

Looking back at my high school graduation seems so far away.  I can still remember  that summer, the one before I left for college: it feels like a vivid dream, so distant in memory yet so close in feeling.  I've spent many nights looking through photos taken that year, and during my college years, with each photo set eliciting memories long dormant.  Each photo always bringing about a strong feeling of nostalgia.

And now here I am, five years later, roughed up, shook up, but still standing.  I'm a man with a degree, one that will hopefully safely propel me into the next stage of my life.  Coming out of five long years of learning, I hope all my work pays off.  I can't stand the thought of all that work being for waste.  I don't think it will be, but the current job market is scary. I'll be the first to admit that. 

So last week I was a student, and this week I'm unemployed.  A chapter of my life is now complete, and I'm excited to find out what happens next.  College?  Check.  100 posts?  Check.  Future?  Let's go.
