Like everyone else, I've been keeping a wary eye on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  It's horrible, destructive, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/us/09rig.html">last attempt to fix it failed</a>.  Fortunate for me and my East Coast friends we are out of harms way - at least for the time being.  Although a solution seems to have been found it may not have been soon enough to prevent the ooze from reaching a major ocean current that could carry it through the Florida Keys and up the East Coast. Not good.
