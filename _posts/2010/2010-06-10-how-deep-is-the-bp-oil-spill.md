This just makes me sick to my stomach:  How deep is the <a href="http://twitter.com/BPGlobalPR">BP oil spill</a>?  About 5,000 ft underneath the ocean's surface.  What does that mean?  <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5560170/just-how-deep-is-the-deepwater-horizon-gusher">Here's an easy to understand and comprehend graphic</a> that gives you an idea of just how freakin' deep the oil is spewing from.  Really, really, gross.
