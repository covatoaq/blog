Through my internet browsing I stumbled across firstly this awesome music blog Aurgasm, and on it they have posted two songs from a relatively unknown artist named Javier Dunn.  I haven't been able to stop listening to his 'If You Go' song.  <a href="http://aurgasm.us/2010/11/javier-dunn/" target="_blank">Definitely head over to the post and check out his music here</a>.  Great tone.  Perfect for autumn.
