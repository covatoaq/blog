This may be just silly enough to work.  Over at NYT there's on op-ed piece that is asking for there to be the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/opinion/10kristof.html">creation of a King and Queen for America</a>.  The premise:  the U.S. president has so many ceremonial duties that it can take away from his or her time from actually legislating.  With a figure-head in place to take over these duties it would leave time for the President to get down to work and figure out solutions to the nation's problems.  I like the sound of it.
