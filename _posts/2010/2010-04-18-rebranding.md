I started this blog without direction.  I hoped that as I wrote entries and grew I would be able to hone the scope of what I post.  I don’t think I’ve narrowed what I will or won’t post, but I do think I have come up with a solution that better encapsulates what I post. 

My solution is a simple rebranding.  No more will you see the bland and unimaginitive title of “Harry Wolff" adorning the top of each page -  Its static letters haunting you from post to post, from page to page, and from link to link.  The horrors that you had previously faced are gone.

May I introduce you to the new title of my website:  Probably Harry.  A site that isn't always about me, but usually - and probably - is.

Looking forward to some good times everyone. :)
