If you haven't been living under a rock then you know about the recent Facebook privacy controversies.  I've read a lot of essays debating many issues, some disagreeing with one another and some agreeing.  From these essays I've found the salient issue to be Facebook's lackluster attempt to educate their users on what information they are sharing.  Fortunate for us a new tool has been released that takes the guess work out of your Facebook Privacy Settings.  Called <a href="http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/" target="_blank">ReclaimPrivacy.org</a>, it seeks to do just that.  I greatly encourage you to click over and scan your privacy settings.  Better to be safe then public!...or an equivalent idiom.
