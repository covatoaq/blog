It's been almost a year that I've had this blog using the default WordPress theme "TwentyTen".  Well, it's about time for a change!  So feast your eyes around...there's new decorations everywhere you look!

In case you weren't sure, this theme redesign is a work in progress that will be progressing in a live fashion - as in I'll be making changes that'll take immediate effect without testing them beforehand.  So if you see something weird don't fear!  I'm probably working on it!

Hope you enjoy!  Let me know your thoughts in the commentsss!
