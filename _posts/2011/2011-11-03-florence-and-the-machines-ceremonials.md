There are only a few songs on the record that immediately stand out as being catchy, hooky, and good.  The rest kind of blend together, carrying the same tone and emotion as each other.

I couldn't really put my finger on why I found the album to be such a disappointment (as I had such high hopes after the great Lungs) until I read <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/">Pitchfork's review of the record</a>:

<blockquote>The same can be said of Florence and the Machine's second album, Ceremonials, which can feel like Welch simply holding out a single note at top volume for an hour.
</blockquote>

And that's what's wrong with the record.  Most of the songs feel like you're being screamed at, and when a slow song comes on there are still explosions of voice interjected at some juncture.

The first three tracks are great and instant pop hits.  The rest of them I'm working at liking.  I hate working to like art.
