<blockquote>The ease of writing - unfiltered and raw -
causes long sentences without break to run-on,
With no interruption and seldom pause in pace
My writing and lyrical prose pose with no sense of space.
For without analysis and self-review,
The writing can often seem stale and far past-due.
And with its stench building in height,
The column of steam evaporates from sight,
Whiffing away without care
And without wonder who put it there.

Because the run-on was not run-down the meaning was far too easily lost drowned in sound.</blockquote>
