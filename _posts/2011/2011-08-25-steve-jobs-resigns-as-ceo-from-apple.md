Announced yesterday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs.html">Steve Jobs has tendered his resignation as CEO of Apple.</a>  Tim Cook is now CEO and from the whispers of the internet it seems like he has acted as CEO for quite some time.

I didn't think I'd be emotional when Steve Jobs resigned - but I am.  The man has had a great impact on my life through his work at Apple.  I write these words on an Apple laptop, I make phone calls on an iPhone, and I relax with my iPad.

I'm looking forward to an Apple post-Jobs.  I'm sure they'll still come out with great products and software.  However I know that I'll always miss a Steve Jobs keynote.  No one can give a keynote like Jobs.
