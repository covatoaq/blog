Among them are True Blood, Weeds, Louie, and Futurama.  What does this mean for me?  Frankly, my productivity level is going to dip as I'll be spending less time in front of the computer, and more time in front of the TV.  Although to be fair all the time that I spend on the computer isn't necessarily productive...it's just time spent trying to lull myself into a state of productivity.  This doesn't always work.  Sometimes I find myself going on Facebook, only to close Facebook and re-open Facebook in a new tab.  So maybe with these distractions I'll find myself even more productive than before, when I didn't have TV shows that I needed to watch.  Just so you know, there are NO spoilers ahead.  I'm speaking as generally as a Major General.

The 'big mother of all attention seeking shows' that made me realize that I was entering into a summer flush with excellent TV has been True Blood.  Entering its 4th season, this show never ceases to entertain and confound me.  The understanding of 'weird' in the True Blood universe is so far removed from any other normal notions of 'weird' that if they were to have a character suddenly turn into Medusa one episode I wouldn't give it much more than a thought.  This show does whatever it likes with its plot, twisting and turning it around so much that after watching a full season's worth of True Blood you no longer exclaim 'WTF' - you merely nod your head and keep watching.

Weeds is back on as well.  Season 7 kicked off last weekend, safely side-stepping whatever plot potholes they may have found themselves in at the end of last season, we're thrust back into the life of Nancy Botwin where reality has taken a vacation and she gets to set all the rules.  And it's fun to watch her set her rules because I know if I tried just a fraction of what she actually does on Weeds I'd never get away with it.  I'd also have no time to write blog posts, but then again I don't think I'd be interested in writing blog posts.

Futurama has resumed their 6th season in good form.  The jokes are top quality and the stories are just as entertaining.  I'm not a die-hard Futurama fan but I do enjoy catching their episodes while I eat lunch.  And besides, anything in any way related to sci-fi automatically has my attention.

Louie is back as well.  Season 2 is underway with an opening episode that further cements the comedic brilliance of Louis CK.  Dude's got some fine jokes.

In related TV news:  I'm catching up on Game of Thrones, having missed it while it was airing.  I can't pinpoint what it is that I find so entertaining about Game of Thrones, which leads me to believe that is just the show in general that I find so appealing.  In any case, if you haven't seen Game of Thrones I definitely suggest you give it a try.

Ah dear TV.  You take my eyes away from my computer screen and plant them firmly onto your own screen.  And you make me wait a week to see something new.  You're so clever TV.
