<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/01/making-a-brain-dump-on-the-internet/brainback-up/" rel="attachment wp-att-1138"><img src="/images/posts/2011/01/BrainBack-Up-300x191.gif" alt="" title="BrainBack-Up" width="300" height="191" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1138" /></a>I had an idea the other day to start documenting all the various pieces of information that I've collected over my years of living.  The types of information I intend to share are those that I have found aren't common knowledge.  The knowledge is more 'special'.  As in - it is highly targeted and specific in its use and application.

In summary, most of the information I intend to share are technical in nature.

However!  It is my hope that through the power of words I will make complex concepts easy to understand.  Skills that once were mysterious may be shown to be as plain to understand as brushing your teeth.  (Which is not to underestimate the difficulty of brushing three times a day.)

I'm starting by fanning out what topics I intend to cover and will slowly update each page with information as time permits.

Get started with the hub page which for now I'm calling Resources.  Click here to read my newly created Resources page.
