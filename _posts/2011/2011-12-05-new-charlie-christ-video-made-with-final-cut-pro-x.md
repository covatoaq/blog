This is the first clip that I used some Creative Commons music and I think the result came out very nicely.  Simply adding some music to the video added a great deal of excitement and flair and helped me obtain a level of quality that I don't think I've hit before.

It was cut in Final Cut Pro X and I took full advantage of all of its new features, such as magnetic snap and clip connections.  I'm so much more fluent with FCPX than I was with Final Cut Pro 7.  Sure I didn't spend that much time trying to learn FCP7 but then again the program didn't make it particularly fun and interesting to learn.

The video is below.  Have a look and let me know what you think.
