Last week two huge pieces of tech news was released. Both have the potential to change the current computing landscape in a big way. The fact that they were both announced within a week's time of each other made last week a blur of commentary and punditry.

The ramifications of this action are great. Through this acquisition Google will have access to a hardware manufacturer, giving them the ability to create an Android phone that they control from the software all the way down to the hardware.

Until now the closest Google has gotten to having complete control over creating an Android phone is through their Nexus program. However they were still required to work with an outside hardware company to do so, leaving room for influences on the final product.

With the acquisition of Motorola Mobility Google will have the ability to create phones that will rival the control Apple has over its iPhone. Apple is currently unique in this industry as the only company that has complete control over its mobile product - and it shows. The iPhone is one of the most best phones available, offering a holistic experience that leaves no aspect of its design - hardware or software - blemished.

When Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility is finalized we may begin to see a whole different slew of Android phones. Android phones made in the image of Google, accentuating the features of Android and leaving off all the cruft of third-party manufacturers. Android phones that work from beginning to end, with no unexpected glitches in-between.

From the sounds of it this will include all of HP's desktop and laptop computers, including all of the products that Palm made before acquired by HP.

From a consumer PC business HP will now focus on the enterprise: serving corporations through hardware and services. As mostly stated over the weekend HP is attempting to pull an 'IBM' and get out of the hardware business and become a services and software business.

Most importantly for the consumer, the HP you now know will no longer exist. The only remaining memory will be the printer sitting on your bookshelf. There will be no more HP laptops and there will be no more HP Pre's or HP TouchPads.

It's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy now however at first glance it seems very odd and highly unexpected. 'Will it work' is the question that will remain on everyone's lips. And only time will be able to provide an answer.
