Just got started with WordPress new and most excellent plug-in <a href="http://jetpack.me/">JetPack</a>.  The gist of this doo-hickey is that it brings all of the advanced features and benefits of having a hosted WordPress.com blog to every self-hosted WordPress.org blog.  In laymen terms that means that I now have access to neat hover-cards, improved Site Stats UI, and WP.me short-links - to name a few.  I haven't had an extended amount of time to play around with every aspect of JetPack but from what I see so far this plug-in seems like a must-have for every WordPress.org blogger.  Kudos WordPress team. :)
