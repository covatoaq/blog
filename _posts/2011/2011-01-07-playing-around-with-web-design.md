I bought the web domain <a href="http://hswolff.com/">hswolff.com</a> a while back.  'hswolff' is the handle I use across the web.  It's not mysterious in any way - simply my first and middle initial and my last name.

Until today <a href="http://hswolff.com/">hswolff.com</a> was a blank page.  Today it's a neat background image and a link back to this blog.

I intend to update it and use hswolff.com as more of a digital playground for whatever I fancy.  I'll keep you posted on any changes that go down.

P.S:  I created a new 'favicon' for this blog and hswolff.com.  You should see it in the tab for this window.  It's my initials ;)
