By trade I'm a programmer.  I program websites.  I create pages like the one you're reading now.  Usually I use tools that have already been built by other people to help me create websites.  Tools such as WordPress and jQuery.  These are ready made utilities that make the entire process of creating a website much easier.

Yet every so often it's nice to create something completely new, something that people can use and appreciate.  That's why I created forgetmenot.

<strong>Forgetmenot is a todo list application that you can host on your own web server.</strong>  It allows you to create a todo, edit a todo, and mark if it's done or not.  These are the simple basic requirements anyone needs for a todo list application.

Forgetmenot is self-hosted which allows you to have complete control over all aspects of the program, primarily the data.  You can put it on any web server you want and do whatever you'd like to the source code.  I'm trying to market it as the 'WordPress' of todo list applications.  Open-source, free, and a pleasure to use.

Forgetmenot is optimized to work on Google Chrome 12+, Firefox 3+, and Safari 5+.  You can also access forgetmenot through your phone.  It's optimized to run like an application on an iPhone.  It runs and looks awesome on an iPhone running iOS 4.2+.
