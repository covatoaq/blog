It's short but remains true to form.  Clocking in at 33 minutes and 11 seconds with just 9 tracks you can't help but come away from the album wanting more despite how solid each of the tracks are.  Coming off the seemingly gigantic 13-track sophomore album <em>The Flying Club Cup</em>, <em>The Rip Tide</em> seems much shorter despite actually being only 5 minutes shorter.

And honestly you can't really fault <em>The Rip Tide</em>.  Each track is extremely well thought out and honestly executed.  Each minute is accounted for, without time being wasted nor rushed.  That's what makes listening to Beirut so enjoyable:  a track may be slow but the purpose behind the pace is clearly defined and executed.  The ballad of <em>Goshen</em> starts slow, with only vocals sung over piano.  As the song moves along it opens up, with drum-rolls, horns, and the all so familiar voice of Beirut's Zach Condon soaring above it all.

Beirut knows their domain and they have it pretty well cornered.  I don't know of many other artists who dwell so comfortably in the sort of music that Beirut creates, however I'd be very interested to hear them to compare.  <em>The Rip Tide</em> is an extremely strong third album that allows you to appreciate it twice in one hour due to its short run-time.  And you will enjoy it twice in one hour because it's that good, and there's nothing out there quite like it.
