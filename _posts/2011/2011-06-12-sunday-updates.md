I've taken this Sunday to refresh this blog.  Some of the pages on the left hand side were growing quite out-dated.  I've now gone through each page, removing those that were not being updated anymore and re-arranging the menu to be a little easier to use.

I've also added a new page to this blog, <a title="Good Reads" href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/writing/">Good Reads</a>.  It's a collection of my favorite posts, all in one easy to use location.  Go over to the page and have a look.  Even give some of the posts a read.  I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy at least one of them. ;)

Also I've ported over my other domain <a href="http://hswolff.com/">hswolff.com</a> to being managed by <a href="http://posterous.com">posterous</a>.  I'm going to use that page as a way to post small and quick style posts.  It should prove to be updated on a daily basis so be sure to check it out regularly.
