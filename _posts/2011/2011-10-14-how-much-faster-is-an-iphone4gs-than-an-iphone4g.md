<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/14/speed-comparison-video-of-iphone-4s-and-iphone-4/">MacRumors</a> scoops up this video showing off the speed difference between an iPhone4GS and an iPhone4G.

Although the difference in speed isn't drastic, as MacRumors notes:

<blockquote>While app launching is a basic task that doesn't show off high-performance graphics and other capabilities, it is one of the most common tasks initiated by users that forces users to wait for the system.</blockquote>

It's safe to say that I want an iPhone4GS.
