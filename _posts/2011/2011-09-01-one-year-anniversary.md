One year ago yesterday my girlfriend and I met. Up until that date we had only talked over the phone or over IM. We met at a restaurant called <a href="http://www.gingermannorwalk.com/">The Ginger Man</a> and haven't looked back since.

To celebrate our one year we went out to eat at the <a href="http://tarrylodge.com/home.cfm">Tarry Lodge</a>. We shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed a delicious dinner. We drove home afterwards and fell into a deep and very sound sleep.

Before we left for dinner we exchanged some gifts. For my girlfriend I got her a very pretty bracelet.

And for me my girlfriend got me an absolutely amazing teapot. I'm looking forward to using this every single day.

This past year has been simply amazing. I can't wait for year number two. :)

Thank you Rachel!  I love you!
