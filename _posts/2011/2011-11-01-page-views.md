Sometimes it's very hard to predict how many hits this blog will get.

For example today I wasn't expecting many hits on this blog.  I was expecting to get a lower than average amount of hits. After all it's only Tuesday, and I only wrote a little post earlier  about my reaction to the new Google Reader design.  All in all I was expecting small things from this blog today.

Yet surprises remain unexpected!  Dare I say - surprising.  This blog hit its average amount of views today and I have no clue how.  I'm not stressing about the positive result, just again curious and fascinated at how unpredictable page views can be.

Of course if I had posted something very interesting today I would have expected a fair amount of hits.  Yet even then, history has proven to me that is not always the case.

Ah well, so it goes.  Glad people enjoy reading things here.
