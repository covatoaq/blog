Just found out:  you can organize your iTunes Library to show your music by artist and by the year their albums were released.

This means that rather than just listing all your music alphabetically by artist, and then by the artist's albums, you can instead have each artist's album listed by the year they were released.

I didn't even know that I wanted to list my music like this, but now that I know I can I do.  Awesome.
