This blog has been updated to the latest version of WordPress, version 3.3 'Sonny'.  This new version comes with an improved admin experience, enhanced uploader, and a lot more.  Check out <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/12/sonny/">the blog announcement on WordPress.org</a> and watch the video to see what is in this upgrade.

If you use WordPress I wholeheartedly encourage you to upgrade your installation.  Not only do updates bring about great new features but they also always come with increased security, making your blogging experience safer and secure.

I haven't delved too far into all the changes WordPress 3.3 offers but I know I'm already digging the new admin experience.

Go upgrade now and enjoy a new and improved WordPress. :)
