It can be so hard to stay awake on Mondays.  It's definitely the weekend's fault for being so lenient with morning sleep schedules.  Waking up at the wondrously late hour of 8:30am instead of 7:30am is downright gluttonous as far as I'm concerned.  The green tea just doesn't seem to pack the same energizing punch as it does on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  It's great and warm and tasty but it might as well be flavored water as far as Monday is concerned.  And these grey skies that seem to wait in excitement for Monday to approach so that they can pounce and cloud up the sky and fog up my mind.  How dreary, dreadfully dreary are Mondays.
