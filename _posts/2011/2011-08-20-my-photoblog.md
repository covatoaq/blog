<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/08/my-photoblog/coffee-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1645"><img src="/images/posts/2011/08/coffee1-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="coffee" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1645" /></a>Not sure if you know but I maintain a parallel blog to this one.  It's found at <a href="http://hswolff.com/">hswolff.com</a> and it's where I post most of my photos as I go about my business.

Occasionally I'll throw in an odd link or two there to change things up but mostly it serves as my photo blog.  It's powered and hosted by <a href="http://www.posterous.com/">Posterous</a> and I use <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram's</a> auto-posting features to push every picture I take from my phone directly to <a href="http://www.posterous.com/">Posterous</a> which then shows up on <a href="http://hswolff.com/">hswolff.com</a>.

It makes for a fine photoblog that allows me to maintain my identity on there without being lost in the midst of any other photo social network.

So if you haven't already head over to <a href="http://hswolff.com/">hswolff.com</a> to catch up on my life in pictures.  Let me know if you liked any in particular.
