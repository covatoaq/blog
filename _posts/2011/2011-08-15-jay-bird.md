Today I was on a walk and I noticed something very unusual.

It was so unusual I didn't quite know what to do.  I stopped, looked around and paused.  I reflected on the sights and sounds and wondered aloud, to no one in particular, 'Why?'

A small jay-bird nearby perked its head up when I spoke.  It gazed at me quizzically, seemingly trying to understand what I was saying, and hoping to answer me when it finally understood.

I kept walking though.  I didn't really want to stop, but I didn't know where I was going.  I was just walking and hoping to find out soon enough.

I had to cross the street, but the light wasn't red yet.  I was so impatient, tip-toeing into the street, hoping to make a break for the other side without getting hit by a racing car.

Soon enough the light changed and I kept my walk going.  Over to the other side and down another block till I realized I was going the wrong direction.

I stopped and went back to that same intersection.  That same intersection with the light that wouldn't turn red fast enough.  I waited and waited, hoping to find that jay-bird again.  I didn't, and the light turned red, so I crossed back over.

About two blocks back the way I had come I came upon a bench and took a seat.  My knees cracked - one, two - as I sat down.  They popped and I winced and I looked over my shoulder to see that jay-bird again.  Damned foolish bird, following me around.  Didn't it have worms to eat?  Or places to fly to?

I sat on that bench for a little while.  Not doing much, but just watching time fly by.  I didn't really want to be doing anything else.  I just wanted to sit and enjoy my time alone, listening to the cars past and conversations float around.

Sure I was lonely but wasn't everyone else?  I would eavesdrop on a conversation here and there and pick up stories about how Mitch wasn't being a gentlemen and paying for dinners and how Marge was always smoking and driving her husband crazy.  Sad people, almost brought tears to my eyes.

I got up from my seat after a while and kept walking.  I walked through town and when I reached the end I kept going straight into the woods.  Just walked straight into them and never looked back.  Never looked back to see what I was leaving.  Didn't care about that damn jay-bird flying around and setting up its perches wherever it may.

I just walked into the woods and made myself disappear.  I was gone without a song and there would be no tears that would be spilled having had my life to myself.  No one but me was there to cry, and cry I did.  Walking into the woods, disappearing and waving goodbye.
