Watching this video makes me feel incredible small and full of awe.  Real, truthful, awe at how large the Earth is and how much we have yet to discover.  

The stars in this video seem almost touchable and the Earth and everybody living on it seem so incredibly small.

I strongly urge you to take 5 minutes out of your day to watch this video.  It is truly jaw-dropping.
