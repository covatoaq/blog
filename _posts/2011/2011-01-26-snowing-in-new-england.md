It's snowing again in New England.  I thought 'Mother Nature' would have grown tired of dusting us with her white dust bunnies but she seems to be getting a kick out of making everyone's commute a certified thrill ride.  You are so crafty Miss Nature!

I think all of us in New England should just pack up our belongings and move to Alaska.  Unlike here, we won't have to guess if it'll snow.  All guessing won't matter, because it'll be snowing all the f'n time!
