Saw this little guy on my way home after work last night.  On an unrelated note, I love being able to declare something being "after work" and for it to still be light outside.  Simply marvelous.

<strong>UPDATE!</strong>:  I've been informed that is no chipmunk and is in fact a squirrel.  Duly noted and taken note of!  Squirrely thing!
