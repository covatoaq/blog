I've been playing with Java's Spring for the past month at work.  It's quite the interesting web framework, and from what I can see most of its uniqueness is derived from the Java language it's based on.  I wouldn't dare call myself any sort of OO or Java guru, but from what I do know and have experienced the manner in which Spring implements MVC and the creation of web application has a decidedly Java feel to it that I can't help but feel has stuck me in a era before magical frameworks.  Magical frameworks of course refer to Ruby on Rails, web2py, and all other non-Java frameworks I've cast my eye upon.  Ah well, back to work.
