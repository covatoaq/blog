<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/?attachment_id=1985" rel="attachment wp-att-1985"><img src="/images/posts/2011/12/blogging-year-review-ideas-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="blogging-year-review-ideas" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1985" /></a>This is my year in review blog post, and oh what an exciting blog post it's going to be!

2011 was a good year of blogging for me.  I managed to kick my addiction of compulsively checking Google Analytics to see how many hits I was getting and instead was able to focus more on just getting words on the screen and out into the interwebs.

With that being said I did crack open Google Analytics today to do a post-mortem of the year and I must say I'm very pleased!

The top 5 pages sorted by pageviews for  this past year are:

1) <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/09/consume-or-create/" title="Consume or Create">Consume or Create</a>
This one is way out in front of the pack with the amount of page views it garnered this past year.  This feat was largely accomplished through cross-posting the link to Hacker News, generating a lot of traffic and a giant spike in page views.

2)  <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/10/nikon-d7000-mounted-with-a-zoom-h4n/" title="Nikon D7000 Mounted With A Zoom H4n">Nikon D7000 Mounted With A Zoom H4n</a>
3)  <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/11/ken-rockwell-reviews-the-nikon-d7000/" title="Ken Rockwell Reviews the Nikon D7000">Ken Rockwell Reviews the Nikon D7000</a>
These two posts managed to generate a sizeable amount of organic traffic as people searched for information about their newly purchased Nikon D7000 and found some of the information they were searching for on my blog.  I guess the title was also fairly SEO friendly which didn't hurt its search engine results as well.

4)  <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/02/picplz-widget-for-wordpress/" title="Picplz Widget for WordPress">Picplz Widget for WordPress</a>
Sadly I'm no longer maintaining the Picplz Widget for WordPress but it was fun to contribute to the open source community.  People dig Picplz and people love WordPress.  A winning combination of interests made this post clock in at #4.

5)  <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/01/web-application-development-frameworks-part-1/" title="Web Application Development Frameworks – Part 1">Web Application Development Frameworks – Part 1</a>
I never got around to writing part 2 of this post but that didn't stop people from finding it to be an interesting read.  It seems  I'm not alone in finding it difficult deciding what technology I should use.

Something I'm finding very encouraging is that the average amount of page views I'm receiving per month seems to be on a steady increase.  Have a look at the graph I pulled from GA:

<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/?attachment_id=1980" rel="attachment wp-att-1980"><img src="/images/posts/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-30-at-5.30.17-PM-300x42.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2011-12-30 at 5.30.17 PM" width="300" height="42" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1980" /></a>

This truly goes to show that consistency and quality are the key ingredients to a successful blog.

Here's to 2012!  May it bring many more happy posts and even more happy reads!
