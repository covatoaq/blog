Today it is my great pleasure to present to you the redesign of my freelance web design company, <a href="http://wolfftechnologies.net/" rel="nofollow">Wolff Technologies!</a>  This redesign has been in the works for just over a month, going through quite a few changes in concept and approach. 

I've decided to go back to a design style that I find quite beautiful when done correctly - minimalism.  This design approach incorporates both the space used by the content as well as the space left between the content.  Through the wholesome union of these two components it is my belief that it leaves the viewer with a sense of clarity and richness without causing confusion or overwhelmingness.

I believe I've achieved this goal with my redesign.  Although I already have more improvements in mind to add, I felt it was ready to go live in its current state. So if you're looking for a <a href="http://wolfftechnologies.net/">website designer</a> then look no further than <a href="http://wolfftechnologies.net/" rel="nofollow">Wolff Technologies!</a>  We got you covered :)
