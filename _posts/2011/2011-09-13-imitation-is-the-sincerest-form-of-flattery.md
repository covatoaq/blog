It was about a year ago that I finished work on one of my side projects called <a href="http://bestandworstproject.appspot.com/">The Best & The Worst Project</a>.  The concept for the site was simple:  people could post their ideas for what was the best of something and what was the worst of something.

After I reached my first working version of the site I mostly lost interest in developing it any further.  I didn't really see a point to it and as such regarded it as a learning experience more than anything else.

This morning I was reading my tech news blogs as I usually do and came upon this article from TechCrunch:  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/amen-aims-to-find-the-best-of-everything-with-a-smart-interface/">Amen Aims To Find The Best Of Everything With A Smart Interface</a>.  After only reading the article's title I was reminded of something very similar...my site that I created a year ago.

As I read the article a grin formed on my face.  A year ago I stopped developing the site because I didn't feel it had legs to grow but it certainly seems there are people out there who disagree.  This site is nicely developed and even has an iPhone app to complement the website.

Again, I'm not so sure of how large anyone can take a site based off this idea but it's certainly encouraging to see I wasn't the only one with the idea.  In fact it's downright exciting that an idea I had a year ago has seen itself reborn in the eyes of another.  Gives me some nice validation that the ideas I have aren't all just for nothing.

Also you can rest assured that this will only make me work doubly hard on my next site.  It's well under construction and I hope to have it ready for show sometime in the near future.  Near future being the upcoming few months or sooner.
