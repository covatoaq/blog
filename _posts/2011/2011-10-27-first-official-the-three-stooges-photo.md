I've been a big fan of The Three Stooges since an early age.  My father showed me their comical wisdom at an early age and I've been a fan ever since.

A Three Stooges remake is nearing on the horizon and they just released the <a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/10/the-three-stooges-look-true-to-form-in-first-official-photo">first official photo of the new three stooges</a>.

<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/10/first-official-the-three-stooges-photo/three-stooges/" rel="attachment wp-att-1841"><img src="/images/posts/2011/10/three-stooges-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="three-stooges" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1841" /></a>

I'm so excited.
