About a month ago I had the great fortune to watch Louis C.K. in concert at the Beacon Theater.  He was amazing as usual. Full of fresh material and comedy that made my cheeks hurt so much from laughing that at points I just wanted him to stop talking so I could get a break.

This Saturday Louis C.K. is making his entire comedy special available to download and stream for only $5.  The cost is well worth the comedy.  I'm sure I'll be getting my hands on this special to rewatch his jokes.  

To help promote his upcoming release Louis posted an out-take clip from his special.  He talks about evolution and the oddities of human beings.  Watch the clip below and be sure to grab the special on Saturday.
