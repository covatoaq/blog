I was a big fan of <a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2010/06/sleigh-bells-treats/" title="Sleigh Bells â€“ Treats">Sleigh Bells' first album</a>.  The raw sounds and fast beats let the album become one of my summer favorites, a record I could put on and play from start to finish as I drove around with my windows down.

It just so happens that Sleigh Bells released a trailer for their second album today.  It's a short teaser of the tunes to come, overlaid with some fun footage of their tour and just plain goofing off.
