In the land of Harry things have been mighty busy.  He has been away from his lovely blog, out marauding for new land and fresh fruit.  He has been searching high above the coastline, cupping his hand above his eyes to shield himself from the sun's mighty gaze.  He stood there atop the cliff, gazing out past everything that he has since come to call familiar.  He stood and gazed west, straining his eyes from their sockets, hoping to perceive success just before it broached the horizon.

And how did the sun beat upon his brow!  Each un-tamed beam piercing his skin to draw sweat from its pore, their outward push beginning along his perspiring brow.  The sun beat - the sweat swam!  No relent until dawn when the winds from the south picked up their weight and began their singing song.

Yet it wasn't long into the month when Success - in all her wonderful fashion - made her triumphant appearance over the divide.  She stepped into sight as daylight touched the earth, smiling into the future as sun-rays cascaded around.  The last winds of the night picked themselves up and threw themselves into her hair, casting all follicles asunder.  And as she looked down from her perception above her eyes locked with Harry's and time stood still.  Magical white nothingness crashed into existence, erasing Harry and Success, leaving behind nothing but a clean whiteness that bleach couldn't hope to come close.

It is with great joy that I can announce I have accepted a new job.  Starting May 9th of this year I will begin work as Web Developer at GetGlue.com.  The past seven months at dLife.com have proven tremendously rewarding however the lull of the future has proven too great to ignore.  This next month will prove tremendously tumultuous due to all the changes occurring but please bear with me as I venture forward.  Thank you - and thank you - for all of your support over the past couple of months.  It would not have been the same without you.
