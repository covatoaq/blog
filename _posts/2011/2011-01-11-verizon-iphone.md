Who has time to work today when something like <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/verizon-iphone-everything-you-need-to-know/">this</a> is going on?  After so many years of waiting, finally my patience will have paid off!

Although now I am going to need to wait for the iPhone 5 to come out.  Damn the non-relenting forward march of technology.

<strong>Update</strong>:  It's official!  <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/iphone.jsp">The iPhone is coming to Verizon</a>!  I'm as giddy as a guppy!  Get your engines ready!
