If you can't tell, I've changed the theme of my blog.  The old one was beginning to grow old for me.  I liked a lot of what it did, which is why I haven't switched to a radically different layout, but I was yearning for something a little more fresh.  (Also the font choices on the old theme were beginning to really grate on me.  They didn't make any sense and seemed to arbitrarily capitalize things with no reason arbitrarily.  Just like that sentence.)

So this new theme's name is <a href="http://www.elmastudio.de/wordpress-themes/ari/">Ari</a>.  I found it from <a href="http://speckyboy.com/2011/09/05/15-free-wordpress-themes-with-a-responsive-layout/">this post about WordPress themes</a> and downloaded it from the official WordPress theme repository (which always makes me feel safer).

It has three columns like the old theme with the left column staying fixed as you scroll.

For comparison's sake here's what the old theme looked like:
<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2011/09/new-theme-ari/old-theme/" rel="attachment wp-att-1718"><img src="/images/posts/2011/09/old-theme-300x223.png" alt="" title="old theme" width="300" height="223" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1718" /></a>

As you can see, not much different.

But as everyone likes to say, it's the little things that matter!  And matter they do!
