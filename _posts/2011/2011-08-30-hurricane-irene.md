Hurricane Irene has come and went.  She wasn't as damaging as first predicted, however the damage she caused was still pretty great.

The night before the eye of the storm was supposed to hit me in Connecticut I was watching the news.  The news was of course tracking the storm, keeping all of its viewers up to date on its current status.  The news was doing this along with a healthy helping of FUD - fear uncertainty and doubt.

FUD goes a long way to increase a channel's audience, however it can also go a long way to freaking the frick out of someone.  When you add high speed winds outside to the FUD on TV it presents a highly charged situation that is downright frightening.

So I turned off the TV on Saturday night and settled in for the rest of the night with my girlfriend, sipping some Scotch and watching When Harry Met Sally.

The next morning we woke up to no power.  That's what we're still facing.  No power and no estimate of when it will be restored.

I don't fault CL&P (Connecticut Light & Power).  I'm sure they have their hands full.  Although Irene wasn't as destructive as she was imagined she'd be she still lay claim to plenty of fallen trees and subsequently fallen power lines.

So now I wait for power to be restored, realizing for the first time just how damn expensive losing power can be.  All that milk in our fridge?  Bye bye.  All that excellent hummus?  So long!  And all our delicious ice cream?  Well, let's just say I'm not screaming so loud for it anymore.
