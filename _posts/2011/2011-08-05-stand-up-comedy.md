I don't mean that in an overly punny and witty way but the goal of comedy is to get people to laugh.  I love getting people to laugh.

Growing up I was pretty interested in theater.  I took part in a good handful of plays growing up: some were school productions and some were from local theater productions.  I've also tried my hand at improv and sketch comedy in my high school's improv group.  The improv group was thrilling as you never knew what the other person on stage was going to say, in return you were never sure if you'd have something funny to say back.

Stand-up is another beast entirely.  More of a one-man show, when you get up on stage as a stand-up comedian the entire stage is yours with every eyeball glued to your face, waiting for you to say something delightfully entertaining.  Or of course you could say something quite boring and get hit back with a lot of glazed over eyeballs just counting the minutes till your time on stage was over.

The Monday before last (July 25th) I took to the stage to try for the second time my hand at stand-up comedy.  This venture went so much better than my first attempt that I'm actually writing about it.  The first attempt was mortifying and horrible - despite all the supportive voices I heard to the contrary.

Are you interested in what I look like whilst doing stand-up?  The embedded video is below.  I start at the 1:40 mark.  This was my second attempt so be gentle.  Honestly I was pretty happy with how it went all things considered (those all things mostly being this was my second attempt and my amount of preparation wasn't as rich as it should have been).

Ok, enough of me typing.  Here's me talking:
