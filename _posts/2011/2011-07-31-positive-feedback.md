When I make a new blog post I never know what to expect.  Some posts I can predict will do better than others, however there is no way to know exactly how a post will be received. 

Some posts I'm hoping for some positive feedback - or any feedback at all. Sometimes I just want to know that my post was read. Every time I post I eagerly follow my blog stats, tracking how many page views I receive for the post.

I'm not going to lie:  I like seeing my posts get a lot of hits. Sometimes I'll see the post count of my blog spike with no apparent reason and I'll set out on a little crusade to find out why. Usually I'm unable to pinpoint the source but it puts a nice smile on my face and encourages me to write more. 

When I started this blog I did it for my own reasons. I wanted a central place that I could share whatever, whenever. There were many times that I'd sit down to start a blog post, begrudging the self-assigned task.  When I first started writing I would get a few views or none at all. It was at those times that I had to search within for the reason why.  I didn't find a good answer all the time. Sometimes it was just a curt 'because' and then I'd set back to writing.

The reasons I had for writing are still true today. However now I get many more hits per blog post.  It's encouraging and flattering and spurs me to write and create better.
