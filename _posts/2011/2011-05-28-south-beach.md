We're on our way back home after spending a week in Miami's South Beach. It was quite the well needed vacation. I haven't felt weather this hot in such a long time - I almost forgot that I am way over-capable of producing buckets of sweat at a seconds notice.

The weather stayed above 85F pretty much every day, and even when it was overcast it was still magically bright and warm out. Every restaurant we ate at - and they were many - had large outdoor seating with tiny indoor room.    This led me to fear for their livlihoods should South Beach ever face an unusually rainy season. That would strip outdoor room and just kill general tourism.

But that's what South Beach sells and exists off of - sunny days and hot weather.  And there was no short supply of that this past week. <br /><br /><a href="/images/posts/2011/05/20110528-012259.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2011/05/20110528-012259.jpg" alt="20110528-012259.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a>
