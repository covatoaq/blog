Found this link amidst my meanderings on the internet:  <a href="http://www.ruzkin.com/?p=1134"> Why 1000 words a day is easy and quick</a>.  This is a goal that I hope to immediately obtain as swiftly as possible.  The joy writing brings me is great, the mental consternation I impose on myself before writing are unwelcome.  If some system can help mitigate the unwelcome effects and encourage me to write more than I am completely gung-ho on the idea.
