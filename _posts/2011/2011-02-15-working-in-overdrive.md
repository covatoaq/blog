You may be wondering why I haven't been so active here recently (recently being the past two months, which I suppose should more appropriately be described as 'lately').

Work, the 9-5 gig that keeps me warm, has been placed firmly into overdrive the past two months.  This involves long and rigorous days that leave me me thoroughly exhausted when I get home.

The reason for all this extreme activity?  Well, it will be revealed tomorrow.  And I cannot wait to tell you about it then.  =)
