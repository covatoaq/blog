All work and no play makes Harry a dull blogger.  It's not his fault that his work is working him in overdrive, or that he is taking on many side-projects in his free time, or that he is trying to lead a social life.  It is not his fault that he has somewhat of a writer's block, unable to think up interesting topics to write on, right on.

Oh no, it is not Harry's fault.  (The mad ramblings of an overtired human who refers to himself in third person)  are quite mad.

Harry wishes he dedicated more time to dreaming up posts.  But Harry has so many dreams.  And they all fight for his attention and affection.  Oh the dream fighting has got to stop!

Harry a day, harry a night, harry a quarter and three a half nights.

Your regularly scheduled programming will resume shortly.
