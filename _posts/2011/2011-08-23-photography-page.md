[singlepic id=9 w=320 h=240 float=right]Â I've begun a new page on my blog. Aptly titled 'Photography' it will host my photography that I find noteworthy and worthy to share.

It will grow at a steady pace. I'll add new photos from my hard drive as I collect them into appropriate collections and as I take new pictures. I have a lot of photos on my computer. Some are artsy and creative while others are just fun to look at.

Some of these photos have already found their way onto my Facebook photo album's however those photos I keep private like my Facebook account. This blog is public and as such I want to share albums publicly.

I've toyed with the idea in the past to register on iStockphoto or some similar site and listing my photos there to see if I can make a small profit. I haven't decided to do that yet but it may be interesting to try some day in the future.

For now please enjoy the one photo album I have published. Click the link on the left or just <a href="/photography/">click here to see my photos.</a>
