I've wanted to start doing a vlog of sorts here for a while.  You know, get myself in front of the camera, show off my face, my diction, my facial expressions.  I tried once before a while ago but the result ended up being far too messy to make public.  I'm intent on trying again though.  So if you have any encouraging words for me to make getting in front of the camera more pleasurable and less horribly please let me know. :)
