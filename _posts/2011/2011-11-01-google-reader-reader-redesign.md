<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html">Google Reader released their updated design yesterday</a>.

I haven't had a lot of time to play with it but what I see so far I like.

The updated design is minimalistic and stays true to the other design updates Google's been applying to their other products.  Google Reader even seems to load a little bit faster which is a huge win in my opinion.

Some people are upset about the layout of the new sharing options and how it blatantly promotes Google+ sharing.  To that I say: big deal.  If you can help your own product in any way you'd do the same.

The main issue I was worried about when the re-design was announced was that the usability of Google Reader would decline.  Ater using it for one day I find my speed at reading through hundreds of RSS items to have not slowed in any way.

Good job Google Reader team!
