It keeps things predictable, which in turn lets you worry less because you know what to expect.  It's much easier to go about your day with expectations than having to constantly relearn the behaviors around you.

There's two primary sources of habit:  internal and external.  When young you learn a lot of habits from outside influences:  don't cross the street without looking both ways, say 'bless you' when someone sneezes.  These come from your family and friends mostly, and serve as shortcut to societal customs.

The other source of habit comes from you. It is birthed, curated, and finally cemented by both conscious and unconscious internal mechanisms.  These habits have the strongest influence on your behavior, dictating how you meet someone for the first time or how often you exercise.

The variance in difficulty creating these habits depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Getting into the habit of exercising on a regular basis is difficult. Before the habit exists you're forcing yourself to exercise, some days more of a chore than others.  When the habit forms and you settle into a routine it becomes much easier to go to the gym.

For over a year I've been updating this blog at least once per week.  Over that year I've managed to turn blog writing into a habit, something that I just expect I'm going to do before a weeks time is up.

I've decided to increase this rate to two posts per week.  This is a challenge to myself as the quality must remain constant and I need to form a new habit on top of my old one.  I'm curious how this pans out and what new methods I'll create to make the creation of this habit easier.
