There's a lot of engineering noise that goes on in a week. Way too much to keep track of it all. Sure you could keep your eyes glued to your Twitter stream, or constantly prowl through GitHub, but even then you'd be bound to miss more than a few gems.

Yet fear not! There's a collection of folks out there who are happy to do all this searching for you! And not only do they find awesome collections of links to share they also package it into a nice and neat e-mail that they cheerily send straight to your inbox for you to enjoy at your leisure!

What are these things? Weekly Newsletters - and they're awesome!

Really, they're a big part of how I stay up to date with what's going on in the engineering scene. It helps me keep up to date on latest JavaScript trends and learn of new frameworks that are growing in popularity. They also help me stay up to date on periphery topics that I don't get a chance to play with daily yet have great interest in, such as Swift and iOS development.

Here's my list of newsletters that I currently subscribe to. They're in order of value, with the newsletters I find most valuable showing first.

* [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
* [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/)
* [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/)
* [This week in Swift](https://swiftnews.curated.co/)
* [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/)
* [React.js Newsletter](http://reactjsnewsletter.com/)
* [First Round's The Review](http://firstround.com/review/)
* [ng-newsletter](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/)
* [Mobile Web Weekly](http://mobilewebweekly.co/)

Let me know if you find these newsletters useful. And if you have any favorites of your own please let me know in the comments.

**Pro tip**: Create a filter for the newsletters so you can see when they come in, and also browse them easily later. I have one long Gmail filter that looks basically like this: `from:(peter@html5weekly.com OR hello@reactjsnewsletter.com)`. It's a pain to set up but pays off down the road.
