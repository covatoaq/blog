For the past year, at around noon everyday, you would see me take out my phone and snap a selfie. Everyday you'd see me do this. Most people thought I was just posing for a selfie, but when they saw me do it again the next day, and the day after they'd get curious and ask what was going on.

From June 17th 2014 to June 18th 2015 I took a selfie every day. This encompasses the year that I got married, went on my honeymoon, and also moved apartments. It feels good to complete this project, it's been a year in the making.

A few notes about the making of the video:

I used the app [Picr](http://picr.info/) which handled reminding me to take a picture every day. It also handled creating the resulting video, which was quite handy.

The Picr app allows you to set a time for when it should remind you to take a photo. In the beginning of the year I had it set to the morning, however I quickly realized that was not a good time as it wasn't always guaranteed that I'd have a shirt on. Hence why you see a few topless photos in the beginning. I subsequently moved that reminder to noon every day which was a much safer idea.
