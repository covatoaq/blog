Have you heard of <a href='http://www.americanselect.org/'>Americans Elect 2012</a>?  It's a very cool idea to take some of the oldest elements of our political system and move them into the digital age.  American Elect 2012 describes their goal and it is a wondrous if not lofty one:

<blockquote>THE GOAL OF AMERICANS ELECT is to nominate a presidential ticket that answers directly to votersâ€”not the political system.

American voters are tired of politics as usual. They want leaders that will put their country before their party, and American interests before special interests. Leaders who will work together to develop fresh solutions to the serious challenges facing our country. We believe a secure, online nominating process will prove that America is ready for a competitive, nonpartisan ticket.</blockquote>
