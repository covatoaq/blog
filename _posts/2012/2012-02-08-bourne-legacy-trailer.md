Today's been a pretty slow day.  The definite highlight was the release of the <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/universal/thebournelegacy/">trailer for the upcoming Bourne Legacy film starring Jeremy Renner.</a>  I think Renner will make a great Bourne.  So long as the film keeps the spirit of the earlier ones it has all the hallmarks of another great action flick.  I got goosebumps watching this trailer.  Wonderful and delicious goosebumps.
