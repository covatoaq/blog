Although this <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2011/04/27/top-executive-recruiters-agree-there-are-only-three-key-job-interview-questions/'>article about Executive Recruiters</a> might not apply directly to you the advice it contains does.

When you're looking for a job it would do you good to ask yourself these three questions:

<blockquote>
1.  Can you do the job?
2.  Will you love the job?
3.  Can we tolerate working with you?
</blockquote>

The article goes into a little more detail about what each of those questions entail.  But really, the meaning should be self-evident from the questions themselves.  

If you answer 'No' to even one of those questions then I'd say the job isn't right for you.  And if you take that job you'll end up leaving it unhappily.  You have to pay the bills but you should do your best to make sure you're happy doing so.
