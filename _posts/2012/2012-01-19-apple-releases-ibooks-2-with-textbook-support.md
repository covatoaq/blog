Today Apple released iBooks 2 with support for textbooks.  Along with this announcement they <a href='http://9to5mac.com/2012/01/19/heres-the-heart-warming-clip-played-at-apples-education-event-in-nyc/'>showed off a new video describing why they created support for textbooks and how they went about doing so.</a>  The video is typical Apple quality:  endearing and uplifting.  Overlook the length of the video and let yourself be captivated.  This is some stuff that I wish I had growing up.

P.S:  I just downloaded a sample textbook to try out.  It's pretty damn cool.  You can expand and minimize pages and images just like in the video and everything is so snappy.  You have to give it to Apple:  when they set out to do one thing they get it done so <em>right</em>.
