<p>I'm slowly but surely learning how to code like a proper Pythonista.  However there are a few subjects that still cause my eyes to glaze over.</p>

<p>Fortunately a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/9951/e-satis">wonderful individual</a> over at StackOverflow has written out some amazing answers to some advanced Python topics.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/the-python-yield-keyword-explained/231855#231855">The Python yield keyword explained</a></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/739654/understanding-python-decorators#1594484">Understanding Python decorators</a></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python/6581949#6581949">What is a metaclass in Python?</a></p>

<p>I found the Python decorator article to be quite illuminating.  Coming from JavaScript where functions are also first-class citizens I found it surprising to find the same was true in Python.  I think Python's white space confused me, it made all the function definitions look too neat and pretty to be equated with JavaScript function's curly braces.</p>
