I wish we had a US company that <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/01/09/how-frances-free-will-reinvent-mobile/">thinks about broadband the way Free.fr does</a>.  The money quote:

<blockquote>“We are a broadband service provider,” was his matter-of-fact reply. “Everything else — from voice to IPTV to storage – is just a feature that rides on this data service.” For the rest of the telecom industry, long addicted to metered minutes and billable items, this is rebellious thinking.</blockquote>
