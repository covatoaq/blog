<p>For the past week I've become slightly obsessed with animated .gif sites on Tumblr.</p>

<p>Two in particular have been consuming my idle time, with some posts causing me to laugh louder than a hyena.</p>

<p><a href="http://runningastartup.tumblr.com/">Running a Startup</a> has posts that reflect on life at a start-up.  If you've lived the moments the blog posts about then you'll be cracking up right alongside me.</p>

<p><a href="http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/">#whatshouldwecallme</a> I believe is written by a young lady in law school (as some posts are specific to that subject).  Some posts I don't find particularly funny, whereas others I've shared with every person I know.  Two of my favorites are <a href="http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/post/21647498005/walking-around-after-a-mani-pedi">this one</a> and <a href="http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/post/20555004973/when-i-feel-a-bug-on-me">this one</a>, which is easily the best animated gif ever created..</p>

<p>Know of any other funny animated gif sites?</p>
