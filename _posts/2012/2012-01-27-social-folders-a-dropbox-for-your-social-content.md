This is one of those ideas that after I saw it in action I was surprised it hasn't been thought of sooner.  <a href='http://socialfolders.me/'>Social Folders</a> is program that you download to your computer and connect to your social networks, like Facebook or Instagram.  It'll then create a folder on your computer - like Dropbox - and fill it with all of your files that you've put on your Facebook account or Instagram account.  They just created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s2TFsVezZQ">video that shows the program in action.</a>  Really smart idea.  Definitely check it out if you're a big user of social websites.
