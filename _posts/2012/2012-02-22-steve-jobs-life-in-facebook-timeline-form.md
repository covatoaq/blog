Facebook timeline was created to help people express and share their lives.  Someone has gone ahead and <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8GVlYAGCaI&#038;feature=player_embedded'>re-created the life of Steve Jobs as it would appear in a Facebook timeline.</a>  Aside from Jobs' storied life it's amazing how useful a tool Facebook Timeline can be to tell the story of a person's life.
