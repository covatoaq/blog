Did you see <a href='http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/5/2773964/best-buy-super-bowl-spot-features-some-of-mobiles-biggest-innovators'>Best Buy's Super Bowl ads last night?</a>  If you haven't, you should give them a watch.  They feature the creators of Instagram, Shazam, and Square to name a few.  Tastefully done and a joy to see.
