I'm not sure why I <a href='http://kottke.org/12/02/through-destruction-a-washing-machine-achieves-transcendence'>felt so uncomfortable while watching this video.</a>  Perhaps it was due to the somewhat human face of the washing machine.  I couldn't look away as it slowly destroyed itself, at times proud, at times scared.  The machines are alive I tell ya.
