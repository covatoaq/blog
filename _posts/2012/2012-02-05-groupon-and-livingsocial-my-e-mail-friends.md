I just unsubscribed from my Groupon and LivingSocial coupon e-mails. I'm sad to say that in recent memory none of the deals have been appropriate for me. More often than not the e-mails head straight to my trash bin. A few deals I let sit in my inbox for a few hours, giving myself some time to decide if I should trash it or buy it. However in the past 2-3 months all those deals end up going straight to the trash.

Throughout the entire time that I've subscribed to Groupon &amp; LivingSocial I've purchased around 5 deals. Those 5 deals were purchased on 5 separate occasions. That means that from all the daily e-mails I've received only 5 have piqued my interest enough to buy. The ratio of e-mails received to deals purchased is incredibly poor.

I won't lie that waking up to 2-3 e-mails each morning is somewhat of a comfort. I find it mildly depressing when I wake up to an empty inbox. I feel somehow neglected and forgotten. That's one reason why I was never eager to unsubscribe from the Groupon and LivingSocial e-mails. It was nice waking up to those daily deals each day.

For a while I would welcome those e-mails, curious and eager to see if there was a deal waiting in my inbox that was perfect for me. However as the weeks have passed and the seasons have changed I've increasingly found myself beginning a new routine. I now see how fast I can delete the daily deals from my inbox. I hate the clutter the e-mails add to my inbox and how none of them interest me in the slightest.

So today I unsubscribed from all of my Groupon and LivingSocial subscriptions. I will not miss the weight they added to my morning e-mail clean-up. I also do not fear that I'll miss a deal that is right for me. Usually the deals that are truly good people talk about online and share. I know that's what I did. Whenever I found a pearl I would share it with my Facebook and Twitter friends. I just hope that they'll do the same for me now that I'm out of the loop.

So long Groupon &amp; LivingSocial, and thanks for all the (cheap) fish!
