<p>There is nothing stopping me from writing but myself. Not one little thought exists that has such a persuasive pull as to jerk me from my keyboard (physical or otherwise). It's only me. Little introverted me that continuously stops my creative flow.</p>

<p>It saddens me. I have so much I want to say yet nothing is written. In my head I see myself stall. I'll look straight ahead, think "We’re going to write", and then...nothing.  I never get past the thought. I never start writing or brainstorming. I just stop.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'll distract myself. Usually I just do nothing. I stare straight ahead and keep staring. I stare at points that don't exist, willing them to apparate, waiting for anything to break my concentration.</p>

<p>The energy I use thinking about writing is inevitably diverted to non productive gestures. It's funneled, pruned, puréed, and expunged. I just stare and stare till my eyes sting and my forehead creases.</p>

<p>Then I give up. I find something easy to do and forget my urge to write. I push it down and away. Disowned, abandoned, forgotten.</p>

<p>Better to remember a past without failed attempts. Better for my heart, not for my soul.</p>

<p>And so nothing is written, nothing is said, nothing is shared.  My eyes burn, my mind churns.</p>

<p>Thankfully I've saved myself the shame of failure.  The only cost was passivity. Inert and unproductive, yet wildly successful.</p>
