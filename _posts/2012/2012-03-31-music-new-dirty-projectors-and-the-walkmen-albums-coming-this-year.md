I'm beyond words to describe my excitement right now.

Two of my favorite artists are putting out new albums this year.

Dirty Projectors is <em>finally</em> releasing the follow-up to their amazing "Bitte Orca".  They just posted a video for the upcoming single off the new album and it is awesome.  Groovy drum beat, thumping bass line, and the always amazing vocals.

Even more exciting than that...my all time favorite band The Walkmen are putting out a new album this year as well.  Titled "Heaven" it's due out later this year.  From <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/45958-the-walkmen-announce-new-album/">Pitchfork</a>:

<blockquote>The followup to 2010's Lisbon was recorded with noted indie rock producer Phil Ek (Fleet Foxes, the Shins, Modest Mouse) at his Seattle-area studio in the woods. Fleet Foxes frontman Robin Pecknold sings on the track "No One Ever Sleeps".</blockquote>

So that was enough to make me start dancing.  But what really threw me over the moon was the music playing in their newly released trailer for "Heaven".

This is going to be an amazing year for music.
