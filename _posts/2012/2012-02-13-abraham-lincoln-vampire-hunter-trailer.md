Sometimes I find our society's recent obsession with vampires to be quite tiresome.  Other times I find it to be pretty cool.  <a href='http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,1445432033001_2106736,00.html'>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</a> is one example of an awesome use of vampires.

Originally a book that is now being made into a movie, the first trailer was just released today.  The trailer was all nice and ho-hum in the beginning but the last 30 seconds really sealed the deal for me.

It seems that cherry trees wasn't all that Abraham Lincoln cut down...
