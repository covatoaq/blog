The biggest news item today is from none other than that little electronics company Apple Inc.  According to AllThingsD <a href='http://allthingsd.com/20120209/apple-to-announce-ipad-3-first-week-in-march/'>Apple is planning to launch the iPad 3 in the first week of March.</a>  This isn't that surprising as the iPad 2 was released during the same time last year.  What remains a surprise is what the iPad 3 will contain.  

Current rumors point to a quad-core processor and longer battery life.  I'm hoping for one more surprise that'll make me yearn that much harder to pick one up.
