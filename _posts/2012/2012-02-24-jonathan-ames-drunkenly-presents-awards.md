Here's a <a href='http://splitsider.com/2012/02/jonathan-ames-makes-every-other-wga-awards-presenter-look-very-boring'>video of Jonathan Ames drunk, and presenting awards at the Writers Guild awards ceremony.</a>  

I can't really put in writing how great this video is.  Ames is the writer of the recently cancelled <i>Bored to Death</i>, something that he brings up at least five times during his drunken presentation.  His complete lack of worry for his actions makes the entire presentation that much better.
