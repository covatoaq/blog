<p>Over the weekend one of the strangest things happened to me.  I found it so strange because not only have I never experienced this before but I've never heard of anyone else experiencing it either.  Even after searching online I couldn't even find <em>anyone</em> that had experienced this same problem.</p>

<p>Over the weekend my iPad randomly turned off and wouldn't turn back on.</p>

<p>I did the perfunctory reset trick, where you hold the power button and the home button at the same time for 10 seconds.  Nada.</p>

<p>I tried plugging it into a power charger.  Nada.</p>

<p>I tried plugging it into my computer.  Nada.</p>

<p>From every possible angle it appeared my iPad was dead.  It didn't respond to any outside input and the screen remained as black as the night.</p>

<p>There was no water damage, it wasn't dropped, and it was used with only Apple chargers.</p>

<p>So what happened?</p>

<p>I have no idea, and that's what's driving me mildly nuts.  I can have an insatiable curiosity at times and this has become one of those cases.</p>

<p>After I took the iPad to the local Apple store I was fortunate to find I had 13 days left of my warranty, so I got a replacement without any grief.  I asked the Genius if he'd ever seen anything like this before and he said no, only in iPhones.</p>

<p>I asked him if he knew what caused this and he said he had no clue, it was impossible for him to open the iPad as it is sealed shut.</p>

<p>So my curiosity remains irked, searching for some sort of closure to this weird aberration of Apple product quality.  If you have any idea why and how this happened please leave a comment and let me know.</p>

<p>Personally I'm going to hold onto the belief that it was the drive to PA that caused the iPad to become borked.  We crossed into PA for a wedding and the magnetic poles zapped my iPad dead.</p>

<p>Of course that can't be true but it's the only semblance of closure I'll get at this point.</p>

<p>So no matter how well I took care of my iPad it still managed to succumb to Murphy's all powerful law that when something can go wrong it will go wrong.</p>

<p>I just thank the stars that I still had my warranty.</p>

<p>I still have 13 days left to get an extended warranty but I don't think I will.  There was no reason this should have happened and if it happens again in the future I'll be forced to sell the iPad for parts.</p>

<p>But man, that was the weirdest thing.  When does an iPad just up and off itself?  Strange things man, strange things.</p>
