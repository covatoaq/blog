This is a pretty funny comparison of Apple's new <a href='http://dealmac.com/features/Mac-OS-X-Mountain-Lion-vs.-Real-Mountain-Lion/550335.html'>OS X Mountain Lion vs. a real mountain lion.</a>

<blockquote>OS X Mountain Lion's Messaging: Messages App combines iChat and iMessages to sync all of your conversations across AIM, Jabber, Google Talk, Yahoo! Messenger, and across all your laptops, desktops, and iPhones.

Mountain Lion: Mountain Lions are solitary animals, so they prefer not to chat with anyone.
</blockquote>

Pretty funny.
