Lytro is one of those amazing companies that has created a new piece of technology that is wildly like nothing else.  <a href='http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/16/view/17157/lytro-light-field-camera-now-available.html'>Lytro's cameras are able to take a picture that can later be refocused to any point in the image.</a>

There have been whispers that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/01/23/steve-jobs-looked-to-reinvent-apples-iphone-photography-with-instant-capture-system-advanced-light-field-sensors/">Apple is interested in lytro's technology.</a>  Imagine lytro's technology in your next iPhone.  How wicked would that be?
