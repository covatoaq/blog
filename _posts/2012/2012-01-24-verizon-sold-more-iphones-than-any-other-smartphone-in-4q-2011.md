<a href='http://www.macrumors.com/2012/01/24/iphone-represents-55-of-verizons-4q-2011-smartphone-sales/'>Verizon released their sale figures today for the last quarter.</a>  The big takeaway?  More than 50% of all smartphones that they sold were iPhones.  To be exact 55% of all their smartphone sales were iPhones.

<a href="http://parislemon.com/post/16413547331/more-than-half">MG Siegler puts it nicely</a>:

<blockquote>Every single Android phone that Verizon sells — dozens of models — combined could not outsell the iPhone last quarter. When you consider that Verizon sells plenty of BlackBerrys (and a few Windows Phones here and there) as well, this is even more incredible.</blockquote>
