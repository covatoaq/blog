<a href="http://blog.harrywolff.com/2012/01/short-term-long-term/stopwatch/" rel="attachment wp-att-2091"><img src="/images/posts/2012/01/stopwatch-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="stopwatch" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2091" /></a>Here's a quick idea for a website.

Focused on the interpretation of current events the editorial style is one that discusses the short term and long term effects of news.

With a tentative name of ShortTermLongTerm.com the site would make digesting and reacting to current events easy.

The easiest example right now is with the looming SOPA vote:

Short term effects:
<ul>
<li>Mostly none. Sites will continue to operate without any immediate interruption. </li>
</ul>

Long term effects:
<ul>
<li>Your favorite websites might experience occasional and sporadic spouts of downtime, going dark and unreachable as IP infringement inquiries mount.</li>
<li>New novel companies are limited in their creative scope for fear of attack through the SOPA act. If Facebook were to have been created post-SOPA they could face early attack and downtime due to complaints.</li>
<li>Future laws piggy-backing off SOPA arise and are based leading to tighter control over the Internet by the Government.  Big brother becomes real and a threat to daily internet use.</li>
</ul>



I'd love to create this site however I'm not sure on what's the best approach:  maintained by editors or a community.

What are your thoughts?
