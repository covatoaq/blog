<a href='http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/02/28/apple-announces-ipad-event-for-march-7-in-san-francisco/'>The iPad 3 is coming.</a>  Hopefully along with Apple TV 3.  And a new iPad cover.  I hope the iPad cover is backwards compatible with my iPad 2.  There's only so much money I can spend on Apple products in a year.

And we haven't even begun rumoring about the iPhone 5.  This year is going to be exciting.
